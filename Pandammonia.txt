Honestly man if you're on TV and in documentaries and coming out with "the moon is hollow" you better be prepared to back it up with some serious evidence, and I don't mean "it rang like a bell", 100% agree with this.Follow the Standards of Civility:

Alright we need to shake off that bad stigma we attached to UFOs, UAP's it is! Oh hang on we forgot water! Duh, okay UAUP's it is.

Hang on, is space really air? Let's call them UAUSP's. Hang on what if it's already been identified and we just don't know it? Okay, IAUSP/UAUSP's. We forgetting anything? No? Okay that sounds pretty catchy, IAUSP/UAUSP's it is.

Alright now we've got that out of the way, I'd like to introduce the Office for the Identification and Surveying of Identified Aerial Underwater Space Phenomena/ Unidentified Aerial Underwater Space Phenomena, but we just call it the OftIaSoIAUSP/UAUSP, .. for short.Are u okay OPIF this is true I think private ventures into space exploration would be taken aside and told?

"balloons" etc are removed for being low effort, I just figured i'd let you know that if youre going to post something like this its usually better to add a reason why you think it might be chinese lanterns, or why it could be, even if its something as simple as pointing out something about the video/sighting that you think strongly resembles a chinese latern or whatever or your comment will probably get removed, just wanted to let you know instead of just removing it.No low effort posts or comments.

    One-to-three word comments or emojis.Id imagine the majority of us who've been in the subject for a long time either never had our hopes pinned on disclosure, or very soon stopped wishing it would come along, if you're in this subject waiting on disclosure then you're 100% going to end up disheartened, the entire history of Ufology is absolutely riddled with hoaxes, misinformation, lying, government campaigns to make us look like idiots etc

I'm here personally because I know there's something too this subject and I would /like/ to know what's behind it or what it is, I know a little more now than what I did 10 years ago and things in the last few years have moved a hell of a lot faster than they have in any other two year stretch, a lot of us don't "need" something back from this subject, we find the subject itself interesting and we enjoy reading about it and hearing the news, that in itself keeps me interested at least.Well when i say "choose not to believe in them" i dont really mean it literally, I believe if you sat someone down and systematically said to them, look, heres a pentagon official telling us there is something in the air we aren't able to explain, here's an ex-president, heres a video and radar data and testimony from multiple sources etc, I dont think they would just "ignore" that per se, but i do believe its a topic that people worry very much has the potential to either shake up their beliefs, a lot, or lead them down a path of thinking that might result in some sort of existential crisis.

&#x200B;

I'd never suggest we ignore the problem, burying our heads in the sand wont negate the problem, but what I am saying it that i fully believe that right now AND in the past, people, programs and organisations have been \*extremely\* active in trying to get to the bottom of what the phenomena is. Where i think the grey area starts is the publics NEED to know and when we start to consider how much damage the knowledge of this subject could possibly cause.

Am i personally all for disclosure? 100%, but on that same token i can fully empathise with the people who possibly know a lot more than us and perhaps what they know has lead them to, correctly or incorrectly, assume some things, possibly some huge things, like where we came from, who we actually are as a species and why were here, things about religion etc, and if i had to make a decision regarding releasing information that might possibly cause a huge stir in those areas, and my job description included doing things to prevent harm to the public, acting in the \*majorities\* best interests, then i would think extremely long and extremely hard about a) how quickly i disseminate that information, b) what the reprecussions of it are going to be and in all honesty, wether or not it actually makes sense to do so.

As they say public interest isn't what interests the public, it's whats in the publics best interest.In all honesty if I told someone multiple agencies have come out and stated that they don't know what is flying around in our air space and that person still refused to believe there's something to the subject I'd probably assume they'd either made their mind up already or they had a problem with actually believing in UFOs, and I honestly think a lot of us would do well to remember the latter of the two, some people are happy going to work five days a week and spending time with their friend and family on the weekends, maybe watch some sport, and repeat the cycle, they don't *want* their world turning upside down, they might not be equipped to handle such a revelation or whatever.

Do I think it's healthy to pretend something doesn't exist or conciously ignore it? No, but I fully respect the people who've made that choice, not everyone HAS to believe in UFO's and just because we're ready for disclosure, it doesn't mean everyone on the planet is, or even that it's a good idea.This subreddit is specifically for the discussion of Unidentified Flying Objects.

    You may attack each other's ideas, not each other.Yah I do get where you're coming from in all honesty and I understand it's frustrating to see similar posts frequently, it's not like the issue isn't on the radar either but I'm sure you can imagine every solution inevitably has a drawback or can be argued against from some point. I think one of the more important issues is to make sure we never stray into territory that could be seen as being censorship or acting in a way that looks like a narrative is being pushed.

One of the better parts of this sub is that the mod team is made up of people with views and beliefs that cover all parts of the community, every reasonable suggestion I've ever seen on this sub has at the very least one supporter in the mod team and there's extremely competent people involved in this sub who really do make it their job to ensure things are kept fair and level across the board.

I've said this before however and it's still my belief that as of right now/recently were seeing a huge increase in interest in the subject and it's an in-thing to see a UFO, it's trending on social media, were in the MSM a lot more and we shouldn't forget that this is exactly what we've strived for for a very long time and it's essentially just a result of the increased exposure, what's important to remember is the more interest we garner the more momentum this subject will build, is it unfortunate that we see a lot more posts that aren't exactly the best sightings? Sure it is, but at the same time in my opinion it's worth putting up with to keep this topic at the front of people's minds, to make sure congress knows the public is bothered about the subject and to keep discussing it openly, to both remove stigma and increase credibility.You might have upset a lot of the community but at the end of the day if all you're presented with is information like this and you come down on the opposite side of it you should be at least willing/able to put forward some opposite points, we all *want* this to be a UFO, but we shouldn't deceive ourselves into believing it is because of that, I'd be willing to bet just as many of us appreciate yours and op's posts.Communities are for more than just what we would class as quality posts, is there really any harm in taking the time to help educate someone new? I don't see a problem with educating people new to the topic, which with the huge uptick in media coverage there are going to be a lot of, and maybe they'll go back out and get better data or contribute more to the board, I don't see what damage it's doing if we tell the OP how to use the time and location of his sighting to check flight data/ISS/starlink and teach them how to rule out the more mundane possibilities and if anything, I would argue that one of the bigger problems this board has right now is the amount of arguments, bickering and negativity that seems to be so prevalent here

I think it's an excellent idea and it's well worth having its own sub even if people class it as a niche, think of how many UFO hotspots are around water, or how often UFOs are seen above water, generally hovering or seemingly scanning or interacting with the water, the fact UFOs are trans-medium and that even UFOs over land are often seen near large bodies of water, really good idea OP I'll for sure join.Follow the Standards of Civility:

    You may attack each other's ideas, not each other.The low effort thing itself is vague and quite hard to actually define and as /Kanein said above oftentimes its better to just air on the side of caution, there's nothing to say the OP isn't being genuine and that wasn't the best picture he was capable of getting, considering sightings from users are one of the bigger sources of our data and one of our subs purpose is to help users identify what they saw I think it's only fair we treat anyone who claims to have had a sighting seriously and unless it's blatently obvious someone is trolling I think everyone deserves the time of day to be heard here.

Sure it inevitably let's some bad posts and comments through but to me things are better this way that the alternative, I actually think it'd be unfair on witnesses to have their sighting and "quality" of sighting judged by a moderator, how would you feel if you had what Yiu thought was a genuine experience and didn't manage to get much good data and as a result of that your post either wasn't treated seriously, or wasn't allowed at all. Seems like it'd be a really bad look to me.Follow the Standards of Civility:

    One-to-three word comments or emojis.I don't disagree with you, I often try to point out to people that we need to be more understanding of people new to the topic and i won't pretend that the influx of trolls isn't a big force behind this, but at the same time I often see the same levels of negativity coming from long term sub members or people with a long standing interest in the subject and I think this is even more harmful in the long run, what I think is happening is this new troll problem has cropped up, and our longer standing members are fed up, so someone with zero interest in the subject thinks they've seen a UFO and they post a video that one of "us" might consider crappy, instead of educating these people and taking the time to explain their sighting, which is one of the main purposes of the sub, the new attitude among some is "we need to run these idiots out of our sub as they're bringing the quality down" and no one is doing anything about it.

It's a difficult problem though and people taking matters into their own hands are helping foster this negative environment, more to the point if we start attacking anyone who brings us a video of an "obvious balloon" very soon no one will want to come here and discuss what they've seen through fear of ridicule and we'll get zero evidence, sounds familiar rite, as I said I don't pretend trolls and bots aren't contributing, but by fostering a negative attitude yourself, you might as well be joining in with the bots and again I think the best way to combat it is to be present in the comments, not attacking new members for "shitty videos" and if necessary explaining we have a bot problem and to ignore it for now.

I know it's not ideal but I don't think the situation is immediate admin action either and I actually think it's the heights of hypocrisy that those who've been ridiculed for their interest in a subject for so long are willing to adopt the exact same attitude regarding people acting exactly how they probably once did, the UFO community has always had infighting but at the same time we've always respected our own and looked after each other, it's always been a sort of "well they're an idiot but they're OUR idiot" and I think we could be doing a hell of a lot more just as a community to combat what's going on hereI'm not really arguing for or against Valle's work, I don't disagree or pretend to even be in the know enough to make a judgement on wether or not his work is valid, I'd just question wether or not were making the wrong connections, the owl connection with UFOs is still heavily present today in the literature but most link that to Athens or Diana, im aware the idea is that it's controlling society through "mythology" in a way that we have no influence over but as I said I struggle to get on board with it because as vallee himself admits were lacking solid data, i wouldn't dream of trying to disagree with the guy, I'm just saying theres also a lot of cases that are outliers and personally I don't think one 'phenomena' or controlling power, whatever you want to call it, is responsible for the entire thing.

And sure the Nazis and die glocke/the flytrap are very interesting subjects but the SS and Himmler were very pro occult in general and there's just as much reason to believe that this was a feedback loop that Himmler was engaged in, let's not forget Himmler went as far as attempting to set up his own Camelot with a room set aside for the holy grail and a room named after king Arthur and the guy was obsessed with the grail and thors hammer, the Nazis drew a lot of inspiration from Guido Von list and the templars/crusades as much as could be attributed to anything else, if not moreI think Ufology has a bit of a unique situation in that most people have wanted nothing to do with it or be associated with it for what, 8 decades? And now after, OUR OWN, (important imo) efforts were now getting: increased media coverage, being taken more seriously, being discussed on social media, and the biggest side effect of all this is an increase in interest and people participating and with that, unfortunately, comes trolls, shills, bots call them what you will.

Ufology is and always has been a fringe topic and there's some extremely passionate people in the community and unfortunately this makes both those people and the community overall what some look at as an easy target or an entertaining one, ultimately it's nothing new, we've put up with ridicule and disbelief since day one, I understand it's a sore topic that it's infiltrated "our space_ but this was always going to happen and quite frankly I'm really surprised it's taken this long. Throw in the misinformation and already established cover up elements and it's a melting pot imo, I don't think it'll last or at least, I don't think it'll be this bad forever, people trolling communities get bored, the communities get used to it and its no longer as effective as it once was etc

I think the best way we can combat this isn't by excessive bans or new rules or new flairs or anything like that, it's just to acknowledge that it's happening as a community and not to pay these people attention, it's very easily spotted and ignored and we shouldn't let it detract from our own conversations or were just playing into their hands.This subreddit is specifically for the discussion of Unidentified Flying Objects.

    You may attack each other's ideas, not each other.I think there's evidence for and against this though and you need to cherry pick your cases to make it fit kinda, the cultural thing is based on the ides that the phenomena has cloaked itself chronologically as "cities in the sky" > phantom blimps > ghost rockets/foo fighters > flying saucers > tic tacs, as you said in the cultural garment of the day, but I think you have to ignore a /lot/ of sightings for this to fit, what about the fact there's records from antiquity of 'flying shields", those sure sound like UAP, or the fact that tic tacs have been reported for a long time and at the same time as when flying saucers were the technology that was "just out of reach", people were just describing what we call a tic tac as a flying butane tank. I could point out any number of sightings/descriptions that throw off this timeline of culture cloak thing, so whilst I do kind of agree that there's a general trend of what's been presented to us, I also don't think that the phenomena is doing it for that reason.

I also don't think anyone has ever thought that UAP/UFO technology was like, the next logical step in the evolution of our own aircraft, I can't imagine anyone seeing a UFO in the 40's and thinking it was a technology in reach, I can imagine people always thinking it was probably thousands+ years ahead.

I'm not disagreeing with you here btw, Im just saying I also find it difficult to see how anyone can extrapolate meaning from it, I don't really gel much with the whole control system thing vallee puts out, I'm of the opinion that if the phenomena wanted to influence us or control us in some way, it would be done in a way we had absolutely zero idea it was happening and not in a way we can make sense of through simple observation, I mean wouldn't the fact that the control system itself was observable scrap the fact it was a control system? 

Idk though, can't really ascribe human motivations or logic to something we know as "the phenomena" lmaoNice to see someone who's actually grounded in reality and will happily admit that there were bugs present, nice attitude to see, also Roseberry topping is super close to me too so this caught my eye straight away, glad to see other northerner's with their eye on the sky x)That's fair enough, I don't mind people being skeptical, but I think even skeptics should be wary still, there's the very real possibility that something is here that isn't ours and outclasses us by magnitudes of order, I think off that possibility alone anyone who chooses to ignore the possible implications of that isnt being very sensible, let's at least pretend it's all true and a very real possibility until we have it confirmed it ISNT. I'd much prefer to think we at least tried to figure this out or defend ourselves than proceed without doing so on the off chance were being deceived 100%, it actually seems illogical to me but I respect everyone's stance regardless, it's a big pill to swallow and that in itself is easily forgotten once you have.Follow the Standards of Civility:

    You may attack each other's ideas, not each other.They don't mention specific incidents no, but at the end of the day we have something operating in our airspace and over our countries that a) massively outclasses anything we have or could use as defence, b)we have 0 idea of what their agenda or purpose here is. That alone is more than enough for most to put this into the threat box, maybe they know something we don't, or maybe they know just as much as us, but imagine if New York suddenly gets wiped out? We'd be up in arms asking why we had no defence and hadn't been informed of the "possible threat".

If I had an unknown animal that could with pathetic ease end my existence, periodically appearing in my front room, with no indication wether or not it was friend or foe, and no indication whatsoever as to what it wanted, I would 100% consider it a threat and I'm pretty sure you would too?This, one of the more common complaints against people like Greer is that he's grifting for money or fame, I personally don't argue for or against because I think greer has done a lot for Ufology, regardless of his motives right now. Nolan's got nothing to gain from this and in a way, a lot to lose. I get that he's unashamedly interested, but even in this modern day and age an association with flying saucers can still be a very negative thing, I think he has enough faith in what he knows and what he believes that it's a calculated risk for him that he's willing to take, and I'd very quickly trust Gary Nolan's professional opinion over Joe blogs.Follow the Standards of Civility:

Anywho im just not really convinced of the opinion that what we do or observe factors into whatever these things do much, if at all. The phenomena of UAP appearing to act "playful" with other objects on the sky is nothing new and I think it'd be hard to distinguish wether or not they reveal themselves to pilots when there's so much skewing the data when you involve a pilot, average hours actually flying, infinitely more likely to be observing above them than anyone else, the fact that if intelligence gathering is behind this, our military is going to be right up there at the top of the list of priorities, it's a fantastic example of what can be done with a little data though and I think it's useful for highlighting just how important data driven conclusions are going to be in getting to the bottom of what they are.Follow the Standards of Civility:

Our smoking gun could be sat out there and will never see the light of day because of this, its not even related to people being easily offended, my point is that ridicule is a weapon of the opposition, and not only that, it's been arguably their most effective weapon, my issue revolves around us shooting ourselves in the foot.This subreddit is specifically for the discussion of Unidentified Flying Objects.

    You may attack each other's ideas, not each other.Yeah fair enough i can sympathise and i do understand where you're coming from, I'm glad you realize its a sword that cuts in both directions, i just feel that those of us who've been in the UFO community for a long time, more so before the fact that we were even taken remotely seriously, should be a lot more understanding when you look at the long long campaign of ridicule that was instigated, basically from day 1, i think we'd be doing ourselves a great disservice to take any type of stance that leans in that direction and wouldn't be doing ourselves justice.

I know things can seem a bit "anything goes" around here but at the same time i think we also owe it to each and every witness, who genuinely believes they've seen something they cant logically explain in the sky, at least the time of day to have their sighting taken seriously, or debunked or explained or whatever.

I think concerning long time skeptics at this point, if they're still on the fence post nimitz, post AATIP, post congress etc, then its probably going to take a hell of a lot more than a user submitted video to convince them and again, i think the rest of that set should have a lot more sympathy having endured 7+ decades of ridicule.

That's not to say i don't sympathise with you either, i understand its not as easy as "finding somewhere else to go" or "just don't post then", why shouldn't you? the last thing i'd want is people to be put off because they felt like the moderation standards were letting them down or the quality of posts was flat lining, i honestly think were in a bit of a UFO flap at the minute though, the subjects very in vogue atm and its currently an "in" thing to see a UFO, i fully expect this to die down in time but I'm sure you also understand how difficult it would be to put in place rules that say, revolve around the 5 observables, or classify sightings. The UFO topic is more of a marathon than a sprint in my eyes and nothing gets fixed overnight but there's an excellent mod team on this sub with opinions on both sides of the line and i've always had faith in them.

Thanks for explaining too, i was genuinely curious and i think everyone in this community's opinion should hold weight,Follow the Standards of Civility:

It just seems like it'd be playing straight into the people who want to keep this under wraps' hands?That you planned on "degrading" people for post what you classed as useless videos basically, I'll happily approve it if you edit that out but I can't imagine you can justify threatening to degrade people if you don't class their videos as good proof.Follow the Standards of Civility:

I think it's thrown around a lot because it's an easy accusation to make, that requires no proof, because no one who's actually working disinformation is going to ever admit it and it also holds a lot of weight when proven, because it shreds someone's credibility, it's pretty much just the verbal method of going for the jugular.

Issues like this are undoubtedly only going to increase as we gain more mainstream media/social media coverage and it's a sad accompaniment to what we've always wanted, which is more legitimacy and attention, I think the best we can do is keep a community spirit and not put any weight into unfounded claims, if someone's just throwing the term shill around with nothing to back up then they aren't contributing anything to a conversation and it's best not to involve them in it in lieu of arguing with them.I think occasionally we all get wound up at the communities we spend a lot of time around, I think it's just a case of some of us being super passionate about the subject and sometimes forgetting ourselves, good job on the spotting!Follow the Standards of Civility:

    You may attack each other's ideas, not each other.This is a really good story/post and I'm glad you posted this, i heard an excellent podcast once that deals with this exact subject and the guest actually sounds a bit like you, it's a bit anecdotal but I've heard time and time again, and if memory serves more often than not with the triangles, that they bring them with them a feeling of terror or wrongness, like you shouldn't be seeing them maybe, or that it's wrong you have.

I sometimes wonder if it's as simple as a human reaction to seeing something so large suspended overhead with no visible means of flying and your brain is telling you to expect it to drop down any second, or the strange fear people have of gigantic objects, I know for a fact I feel that, I've stood next to ships in dry docks for example and there comes with them a strange feeling of fear/terror, I'll find the podcast I mentioned as well because I think you'd really enjoy it.

Edit: https://youtu.be/ezfcGs2ZfQk

This is the podcast that came to mind immediately, they discuss the conciousness effects and hoe UFOs can seemingly manipulate peoples view of the world.

FWIW I strongly suspect that your own experience is possibly a mix of both, I think if we look at the latest evidence being presented and the anecdotal evidence from the past it's a given that these things literally alter brain chemistry, couple that with the fact that they're also literally "not meant to exist" in a way, even if people don't conciously recognise it I think that has all the hallmarks of a traumatic experience.

If you'd seen say, a werewolf rampaging across a countryside, or a zombie rising from the dead, I don't think you'd even question wether or not *just* the sight of such a thing has had an effect on you, yet we seem to think we're in some way capable of processing UFOs visually and mentally, I don't think that's entirely true, UFOs are still very much in that category of weird/high strangeness where in reality we know absolutely nothing about them and seeing them is anything but normal, I think this gets ignored or overlooked though because we've been kind of primed to their existence over time.This isn't being objective at all though. There's a multitude of reasons why this is a bad idea, for starters no one here is an "expert" on the subject, so one day you might run someone out of the sub who has actually posted a picture of a UFO and not even know it, secondly, one of the main purposes of this sub is to identify UFOs, what good is it if we allow a hostile environment to grow where people are "ran out for being idiots" or as I read it ran out for not being familiar with this topic. If we start doing this then a LOT of our potential evidence pool is going to go elsewhere, think about it, Chad Rogers who plays football 6 days a week happens to film a genuine legit UFO and the footage and perfect, he's going to post it here to ask what it is and sees that anyone not familiar with the subject is just insulted and made fun of, so he doesn't post it, ad infinitum.

Another point is the sad fact that news/progress/movement in this field is slow, the majority of the posts are sometimes wrongly identified alien spaceships because there's literally nothing else going on in this subject.

Please don't think I'm having a go or taking the side of the mods here either, I actually agree that the amount of posts from people who have just filmed something weird in the sky has increased massively, but that's due to the fact that our subject has recently gained MASSIVE exposure and anyone who's just heard of it and seen something weird probably wants to be 'in on it', I fully expect the posts will eventually die down or at least reduce in number, but even if they don't, this is the effect of Ufology being taken seriously and gaining mainstream exposure. We can't have our cake and eat it.Well I'm not entirely sure about this particular case of patents, I mean I don't know much about the patent process but I feel like if the someone in power was going to manufacture something we'd liken to a UFO the patent might be harder to access? Then again it could be a private entity who knows, what I do agree with though is that out of any UFO sighting, if one "type" was man made then my money would be on the triangles, even though they've ticked the 5 observable boxes before I just can't ever shake the feeling that they feel more like something we'd make. Purely a gut feeling though, which also flies in the face of evidence I'll admit haha.Follow the Standards of Civility:

Anyways again I'm sorry your post got caught up in this and thank you for being civil. See you around the sub hopefully [=I'm not entirely sure what's happened here actually, the comment that I have removed is under a different username that isn't yours, I've found your actual comment that you quoted above and it isn't what I have as being removed by me, I removed a comment calling the mother's OP ugly and it's still what shows up when I click through my reply, I'm not even sure how your comment has got involved here.

I'm sorry if the comment you quoted got removed, accidents do happen and I'm not even sure how this has happened and I apologise for attributing that comment to you as well, ive told an admin about this and that's when I worked it out but I'll happily link you to where you need to go if you want to submit a complaint for the entire team to deal with x)Im sorry you feel that way, your comment was the only one in the queue that i responded too, i looked at your reply, saw that you were saying you thought the woman posted on a board for unindentified flying objects was ugly and removed it, after which an admin deleted the thread. I'll happily pass on your complaint to those above me though, thanks for the feedback buddy.This subreddit is specifically for the discussion of Unidentified Flying Objects.

Surely this is the only community where one of our own members can do what was probably hundreds of hours of research into a subject were all passionate about, spend even more time assembling that information I to an easily read, logical format (i.e writing an entire paper) and then publishing it on an easily accessed site, for free, for as long as is humanly possible, then actually make it blatently clear and state in their very own OP, that the information will be free for five days, which to me is enough time to read at minimum a 600 page book, then sticky that post somewhere where the majority of people interested in this subject will see it, at the top of the subreddit, so they have a very early warning and then be accused of profiteering and shilling. 

I honestly can't grasp why we launch attacks on people who sacrifice their own time and hours and put work in just because theyre releasing a book, if we keep on this path then at least we'll be able to easily distinguish who is actually telling the truth and on our side r.e research, publications, etc. They'll have fallen behind on their mortgage payments and be spotted on the streets. Anyone else who owns a house and is well fed will be on the government payroll.

Honestly though I think it's a very sad state of affairs when someone in their own community can't even provide the exact type of content we ask for, for free, making clear how long it will be free for etc without being called a shill.

Anywho the auto-mod caught your comment so I approved it : )Im as up for making fun of myself and my friends as anyone else but this sub is seeing far too many personal attacks on other users over *flying objects in the sky*.

It's absolutely ridiculous, were supposed to be a community of people who can work together and share things and work things out with each others help, yet it's pretty much becoming common place for a disagreement of ideas to slowly transform into an exchange of attacks against one another's intelligence, opinion, emotion or knowledge of ufology of all things.

If you disagree with someone then attacking their idea is /promoted/, if you happen to think someones emotional intelligence is so limited they aren't able to experience embarrassment then that's fine too, but there's no need to start pointing it out or trying to joke about it, if you don't think you'll convince the other person to your point of view then that's fine too, state that and move on, there's literally nothing about this topic that's going to suprise me and no one here knows any more about this phenomena for certain than anyone else 

Honestly i'm 125% in favour of banter and fun and if a comment is good natured teasing or aimed at me I don't have a problem leaving it up, but there's a time and a place and if we make that place one of our main forums of discussion we might as well let the government know they can save a few million a year and cancel their disinformation/attempts to muddy the waters because we've actually opted to forgo intelligent debate in lieu of UFO-fight-club.

    You may attack each other's ideas, not each other.No i understand, I mean I wouldn't use the existence of the sims to back up simulation theory I was just trying to point out that things that could be seen as a simulation do exist without an actual real world need for them, I mean what's to say there isn't a being "above" us playing Earth 1.0 and our entire lives span only a few hours for this being, I understand it's wildly out there but I don't put anything past belief nowadays.

On a more serious note though would we even be able to understand the reason for it if we were in a simulation? Surely that would be above us and not something we could find out even if we wanted? We could be an experiment in mass conciousness, i.e there might be a need to work out why something happened and we are the experiment as a result of it, it's not like we haven't done our own experiments into conciousness, from everything from how it can affect healing rates to how it seemingly affects random number generation. 

I don't think it's a theory that can be argued for either way though in all honesty so I don't push any particular narrative or side of the coin because of that. I could say what I have, that we wouldn't be programmed to know we were a simulation, and on the other side I could say "oh well maybe the goal of the simulation is to see how long it takes us to work out", I just think it's a fun theory to kick about because you can let your imagination roam and I enjoy hearing other people's inputs because of that X)I mean you say that but look how popular the video game series "the sims" was, hundreds of thousands of people were obsessed with playing a game that was a lesser representation of their own life, I mean you actually got your sims JOBS in it and waited whole they were at work, I think there not being a good reason is one of the weaker arguments against sin theory tbh, look at the subreddit dataisbeautiful, people on there graph and run simulations or programs of literally anything, there could be literally an infinite # of reasons.Follow the Standards of Civility:

Stuff like the multiple witnesses at Zimbabwe's school landing or the fact that the Roswell incident was apparently the only project mogul balloon that was treat the way it was? Not trying to be sarcastic I'm legitimately curious.

I also wonder how you can justify the statement that distance and time is too far, even for someone super advanced, in the 90s a 1mb internet line was basically unheard of, yet in the space of 20 years look where we are, look at the advances in distances travelled from the Wright brothers to either airline flights or the moon landing, whats to say we won't end up inventing an engine that distance isn't an issue for? Something like a bussard ramjet perhaps? I just don't understand how you can say the distance is too far when we don't even know what technology is yet to come, I fully 100% believe that at some point in our future at the very absolute bare minimum we will come up with some sort of engine/device/call it what you want that is capable of rendering massive distances obsolete, I'm interested in hearing your perspective and viewpoint, I always enjoy hearing from the opposing sides to my beliefs x)Follow the Standards of Civility:

    You may attack each other's ideas, not each other.If you go to richplanet TV on YouTube he did an entire series on human mutilation in Wales and does some legitimate research that spans 3 decades, it's actually really compelling when you hear it and a LOT of things line up, it's supposedly been happening on the brecon beacons for a long long time, think 100s of peopleHonestly most of us here were probably where you are right now, maybe not having thought a lot on the subject or read a lot of the literature, but a lot of us have moved away from "nuts and bolts" to embrace the idea that whatever UFOs (the phenomena) actually is, probably (highly likely) will be explained by concepts and ideas that if you heard them right now, you would class them as woo.

The consciousness thing seems like woo and new age stuff because we don't have a working knowledge of it, but someone truly unbiased will follow the evidence wherever it leads them, for instance as it turns out a lot of the government sanctioned programs around UAP HAVE been looking into "out there" ideas, like wormholes, Stargate's, other dimensions, what conciousness actually is and how we perceive our environment, what's in our environment that can't be seen etc.

If you start labelling thing as new age or woo because of your own beliefs I don't think you'll get anywhere, I really recommend reading some of Jacque Valles works, he addresses the phenomena better than anyone here can in a few posts, in rigorous scientific way, then look into what the government has been up to, what AATIP and AWSAP are saying they did, get up to date on the government verified videos, and don't inject personal bias.

Can you really say we understand everything around us 100% right now? If you can't then no idea is new age or woo, its just something we don't understand yet.Follow the Standards of Civility:

Get a report that mentions a portal and immediately set it on fire because it's 'ridiculous', I've seen him happily accept mundane things explanations for things and I think this is another great point, if something isn't a UFO to Taylor it's no big deal, he's seen probably thousands, whereas if someone who was extremely staunch in their belief that UFOs were just the area of nuts and loons, it's very likely that scientist might not try too hard to find prrof, I mean it's someone who believes aliens are here already anyway, Vs something who refuses to believe aliens even EXIST? And! Upon finding out they do, his head would probably go into meltdown lulz>disappointed in the food

    You may attack each other's ideas, not each other.Don't get me wrong im not arguing of earth or the solar system being anything but natural, if anything I subscribe more to the idea that were only witnessing something so rare because we are, as in the only reason we can say there is a rare earth theory is because the earth is rare, its by its very nature of being that its a thing, but regardless you might be suprised by the amount of things that fall into the category and even accounting for the size of the universe, when you look at the number of conditions and the chances of their happening, it seems pretty rare to me, it's everything from the composition of our solar system itself, where larger outer planets protect our smaller inner planet, to cosmic events leading to other things occuring like the axial tilt of our planet. I'd really recommend having a look at some of the work thats been done on it because the list is actually suprisingly long and the chances of just a few things on it happening, let alone every single one, are mind boggling to me.Im not all that familiar on nick pope, i've heard him in a few interviews, last one i heard him in was an old coast2coast rerun iirc, I think the other side of the coin is that it's so rare to hear from someone who actually worked for the government/in an official capacity concerning UFO's, and he said he'd had to submit what he planned on talking about for approval which sort of implies he might have some inside knowledge? 

Although now i think about it nothing he really said wasn't anything I couldn't have glimpsed myself through reading FOIA or even just public reports, i'm glad you said this actually, i'd sort of heard he worked for the MOD and just ticked him off as being "certified" which is a pretty silly thing to do in hindsight without looking into it myselfAlso just to point out OPs actual camera (used) retails starting at 900 for me on Google. That's over 2 months rent for me personally, so unless I need a camera for a job or I suddenly develop a massive interest in photography then I can't imagine the majority of the planet having a better camera, and even his photos are arguably unclear.I wasn't trying to be a smart arse saying "go take a photo", I think it's hard to appreciate just how difficult it is to get a good picture of something flying from the ground, I get that nearly everyone has a camera on them in their phone but the majority of this number falls into the camera not good enough category.

As for people carrying their high end Nikon's etc, theyre probably carrying them for a reason, you don't walk around with a 5000 camera hanging round your neck, so if they're at say, a wedding, are you going to be happy if your wedding photographer seems more like a space cadet than someone focused on your big day?

Now even considering there might be people out there with excellent cameras with good zoom, look at the turkey kumburghaz UFO sighting for a good example here. https://youtu.be/imwqRPr83is. (had trouble finding it myself so I just linked it).

This guy was seeing a "UFO" at the same spot nightly and actually bought extra gear to get better recordings, he zooms in on it, with a stabilised camera that gets a good picture, and people STILL can't agree wether or not this is a cruise ship, lights from a fishing ship, a UFO with an actual group of aliens and a person visible or god knows what else. It's really really difficult.

Edit: also worth noting how much a tiny bit of hand shake can affect a zoomed in image here, so unless you have a tripod with you or you have the presence of mind to grab something like a piece of wood to stabilise your camera, if that's at all possible, you're now looking at needing time to set up gear, to film something in the sky that's probably moving anyway.Totally agree OP, look into the rare earth hypothesis for some more astounding facts that show just how lucky we are to have our planet, honestly some of the coincidences/circumstances are amazing and the list runs long!

I read a good article the other day of 10 things scientists had deemed "impossible" that we have achieved, heavier than air flight, knowing the make up of distant stars etc.

There's some really clever and well thought out hypothetical methods of propulsion already, like the bussard ramjet, the ship from tau zero with the huge front mounted ram scoop etc. I think it's also worth pointing out that it's entirely possible "they" haven't had to do any travelling at all in fact, they were already here.I think this is a pretty common misconception, that it's easy or even possible to get a good picture of a UFO with a phone camera, next time you see an aircraft try to remember to get your phone out and take a picture of it, maybe zoom in like most people would assume would give the best picture with the most clarity and well.

Now if you actually remember to do this, (and this is with you actually having been prompted to do so by someone)  as opposed to witnessing a once in a lifetime experience and having the presence of mind to try to get a picture, you'll probably find your picture is EXTREMELY disappointing, while modern phone cameras are great for up close in focus pictures, far away, fast moving objects in the sky are not at all easy to photograph.

I'm not being pedantic here either I just see this type of comment a lot and I feel like if you think about all of the hurdles in your way you'll quickly realise it isn't easy at all, even just go and try to photograph something far away with your phone, again it'll probably be a crappy picture.

I could bang on about resolution and camera/lens size etc but I'm not going to, if youre still not convinced though read up on why we have telescopes like Hubble and still don't get good pictures of lunar landing spots, long story short you can't have a cheap small camera that can also zoom in over large distances and still resolve good resolution.A very good point and just for clarity im not on the governments side or in favour of denial either but again, let's assume every experiencer is telling the truth, (fyi I personally do), then a lot of these stories, in fact probably most are pretty terrifying. Waking up in the middle of the night paralyzed to see weird alien figures in your bedroom who then abduct you? I actually can't think of many things more terrifying in all honesty, so again how do you justify letting people know that this /could/ happen to anyone, and if you somehow manage to phone the police during it, (you probably won't), they probably won't turn up anyway. 

If the subject had been covered up by your previous peers I also imagine it'd be difficult to find a scenario that justifies the release of information, perhaps the government has actually been waiting for a serious, really organised push from the public to make this subject public knowledge, again I think most people would react in a very negative "why have you told us this" way if there was random disclosure.

I think it's sad that experiencers are treated like mental patients and ridiculed wholesale and I also believe the government has to take the lions dens amount of the blame for it. Sometimes I feel a little satisfaction that they're struggling so much with this after 75 years of denial, ridicule etc and even gaslighting people over the subject to the point they've had mental crises, it's a very sins of the father situation but no matter what happens the book has to stop somewhere with someone.

In time I believe people will come to treat experiencers with a lot more respect, but i don't think it'll happen overnight without some serious event occuring. It's the result of a serious, well organised campaign to make the entire subject seem ridiculous and discourage interest and until someone puts as much effort into destigmatising the subject as they have into doing the opposite it's probably going to remain that way for a while.Just a suggestion but in all seriousness if you believe it's real it wont do any harm for you to try to debunk it yourself, not being pedantic here, if anything being able to say "heres x y and z that shows it actually isnt an aircraft". I get the burden of proof thing too though just saying x)Yeah its difficult isnt it, i think it's entirely possible that roswell being covered up might have been in a state of panic, like realising a huge discovery had been made and perhaps thinking "hey we should keep this quiet until we know whats going on with it", then later on after this, learning more and more about the situation that if anything, reinforces keeping it the way it is, after all if it had already been covered up then it would be easier to just maintain the status quo as opposed to rocking the boat.

Hypothetically speaking i think even just learning something is above us on the food chain and could end us at any time would be enough to justify not telling the general public at all to be honest, how do you come out and let the nation know, for their own good/because they want to know, that something exists that could come to them at any time and do what it wanted with them and there would be nothing they could do about it,  i'd argue that most people would probably reply with something like "if you cant do anything about it why tell us in the first place", in which case the disclosure vs no disclosure thing is a no brainer sort of.

If its something like they're living amongst us and feed off us somehow, it could be spun religiously in any amount of ways and possibly justify another satanic panic too, i think there could be quite easily argued that theres more reasons to not disclose than there is.

I think it's just hard to imagine because it's literally world changing information, the likes of which hasnt been revealed before and the ramifications of which arent easily predicted.I think it's worth remembering that the sub isn't purely to discuss verified UFO sightings or cases and one of its, arguably, more useful purposes is to identify wether or not things actually are in our interest box, one day someone who has absolutely 0 interest in this subject might post what ends up being our champion example, it wouldn't do to have that person put off because we came across as an in crowd imo

It can be disheartening though I agree with you but this subject is more one that's to be enjoyed through the little victories and the more exciting times where you feel a bit more in the know and have somewhere to go for all the latest news, don't lose the spark buddy x)No indeed they wont but thats their perogative at the end of the day and i think it's also why it's sometimes easy for "us" to forget what the situation is like for someone looking in from the outside as well, and also why its easy to get a bit one track minded over disclosure. Sure we want to know and we're ready, operative word here is we, a lot of people either just don't care, or don't want to care. 

&#x200B;

I think overall, if you surveyed the entire population there would be VERY few people, who deep down, if they really thought about this subject, would say they didn't think this subject was serious, but it's just not on a lot of peoples radars at the same time, i dont think a lot of the general public who could give a flying hoot about UFO's particularly want their paradigm shifting or disturbing, so its easier to just hedge in with whats always been acceptable and to declare the subject and its devotees a bunch of loons.

&#x200B;

When you really think about disclosure beyond the us and them mentality of how were being denied information it gets really complicated really quickly and i honestly can't fault people who vote against it in all honesty.Good point OP i think the situation itself and what's going on is quite often a lot more telling than direct so called "information releases".

&#x200B;

I think a lot of what's going on here too is like you state, people are now in the know and they either just want to, by nature, talk about it in public, and also that what they've learned is possibly paradigm shifting information and they just feel an urge to share it with people and feel like it \*just should be known\*.

&#x200B;

I can actually understand the reasoning for no disclosure when its "oh but it might be something really disturbing". What if it really, like really really, is something disturbing, something that would keep a lot of people up at night say. I personally think it should be shared regardless, because denying it or not discussing it doesn't make it go away, but i also wouldnt like to think that i had that decision hanging over my head. I think it's very easy to be on our side of the fence and have 0 information and think we're just being kept in the dark because, but when you consider its more of a; finding out something terrible that you should tell a loved one because it concerns them but you dont want to, then i think it becomes a lot easier to appreciate why some people are still holdouts against discussing the subject.

&#x200B;

Like i said though good observations OP, worth thinking about and looking into some more me thinksSeeing this comment so often makes me feel like we're living in a simulation.A networking degree would for sure help, at some point theres going to me a module on security right, and how is security taught? Think of a real life front door being in a construction security course, do we want our door open,? No we want a lock on it, should out door be made of paper? Hmm bad idea, what about the doors surrounding framework etc etc,

But in general it would teach you the things you need to know as above, and then when you hear a lecturer or a person or whatever say "and for the love of God don't leave it as xxxxx " you'll learn about vulnerabilities. No ones going to give you a list of anything because that list would be too long, there's an old internet joke here about the internet being built in an an odd matter and it applies.

My point is if you're good enough with the internet then youll know what you need to protect a server or network from, and that in itself is the equivalent to don't mix x and x chemics in chemistry.For a serious answer if op is seriously interested because it's an *investment* of time in major proportions.

Learn how to the internet actually works, and by how it works I mean down to its very basic level, how data is sent between connections, learn about TCP/ICP, SSH, get a GOOD grasp of what's going on behind the scenes, then when you understand how it's working, learn about rh latest security methods, how they themsleves work, what a cross site request forgery token does, what cookies do and how they can be used, then when you know enough about all this type of stuff you won't need someone to teach you how to do anything, because you'll be able to think to yourself, hmm how would I go about doing X or Y or why WOULDN'T I set this up like this, hacking isn't taught, it's just something you learn AS you're learning about IT networksSweet, thank you, I've added quite a lot today and it's sort of broke a few pages, things work differently from being on your local computer to running remotely but I've been at it most of the day so I'm going to take a break read get dome sleep and I'll get it working first thing x)So to avoid spamming the sub and posting off topic stuff and getting on people's nerves I've started a sub at r/OnlyUFOfans where I'll post all my updates and take feedback etc. Itd be nice if people could join there and we can start working together some x)Thank you, I started a sub at r/OnlyUFOfans to keep any posts related to it outside of this and other subs, feel free to join!I've started a subreddit at r/OnlyUFOfans where I'll keep discussion related to the site to avoid spamming and generally annoying members of this sub, feel free to join x)Thank you I appreciate it : )Thank you, there's not really anything tied into registration at the minute, i was going to add a forum but j was spreading myself thin and decided to just get it up and operational, its hosted somewhere free for now but long term, if there is succeed/demand/enough activity Ill migrate it to a better host, rest assured though any data/information etc won't be lost even if it means me sitting there and transcribing everything, my main interest is other people's perspectives.Thank you very much and yes I actually agree it looks bland rn, I don't want to get too off topic about why it does but rest assured it won't for long! I'm going to slowly chip away at extending it and added functionality as it go x)I see your point but the fact that this took place in space probably adds a hell of a lot of grey areas, let's say there's a Chinese team and an American team in recently discovered PandaLand, which happens to be in view of both America and China,  both have idk secret bases there that no one knows the purpose of and teams are regularly sent out to photograph each others bases, one of these teams is captured, their cameras and other intelligence gear is taken from them and they are left go. 

Is it really a declaration of war here considering its already kind of immoral to taking photographs and gathering information on each other countries without permission, pretty much purely in the pursuit of surveillance and usually, determining military strengths/activities etc? 

Are we also really to believe that hasn't been circumstances on earth already where US intelligence has illegally or at the ABSOLUTE least immorally used methods of obtaining said information?

I don't disagree with you that the act of doing it is a pretty serious thing, but when you take a step back and look at where it happened, the fact that it sounds like the satellite wasnt just destroyed and the gray area of the laws of space and space piracy (space piracy is finally becoming a thing THANK GOD) I'm not so sure.I think a lot of the problem stems from the fact that it's difficult to generate serious interest in a person if something doesn't affect them, in theory nothing *really* has changed, i understand the government/officials finally admitting that its real is a big issue but most people never needed their confirmation to begin with. The majority of people don't wholeheartedly think that UFO buffs are insane, they just don't dare stray outside of social norms and start talking about a subject that the government has told them is taboo and a major signal that you need mental help. The common belief amongst people is that it's actually ignorant to think that we are the only forms of life.

If an alien mothership suddenly appeared over New York do I think that would change things? 1000%, but only because that event has the potential to affect us. Right now talking about and theorising over UFO's isn't putting food on anyone's table, it isn't paying electricity bills and even worse, it's doing your reputation very little good.

The stigma that's been thrown up around this issue by the government over a process of 70+ years is doing a lot of work here too, the average Joe has had it drilled into them their entire life that to talk about UFOs is to be a kook, that isn't going to change overnight and unless that alien mothership turns up it probably isn't going to change any time soon either.

I think if you sat someone down and really explained it to them, drilled it into them that this is a real thing that's happening, if they already didn't, they'd realise this was major news, but it isn't on people's radars, people aren't really being told that this is a major issue by what needs to be doing the telling and that's usually MSM. Send this person back into society and they'll probably bring the topic up once, amongst friends, be looked at concerningly and probably hear something like "Oh you haven't been spending too much time on the internet have you?" and end up feeling like an idiot and not mentioning it again.

Look at the difference in reaction between the invasion of Ukraine Vs say the annexe of Crimea as an example, arguably the Crimean affair is a bigger issue, but compare the public's outcry to the two? To most people Crimea was just "the east doing what they've always done", Ukraine is an absolute tragedy and as a result Russia has been ostracised and the major difference is the attitude people have been told to have.

End of the day if someone isn't interested in this and no one in power is drilling it into them to be interested, then they just aren't going to think it's important and be interested.:(The skeptics have a view of reality that yes, is "scientifically" backed up, but 200 years ago it was science they the earth was flat, or when the Catholic church wouldn't look through the telescope because it was science the universe revolved around us. I think as always it's just the usual repeating hold outs of this is what we know right now, anything else suggested is just silly. I know that's taking it to an extreme but it isn't that far off the meta.

All your personal views are extremely interesting too, I never dismiss anything that is based on someone else's senses regardless of how out there it sounds. If someone saw it or experienced it there's absolutely no reason it couldn't be true/real.

The video game reality thing really resonates too, I like the view of; we will eventually get to a point where we can create a simulated reality, so what's to say we're the base level reality really? The other day I was even thinking, "well be able to make simulated realities about the same time they look (graphically) like real life, but what's to say what we see is the highest definition of anything? Maybe an aliens eyesight to us is like our eyesight to a gheckos and the aliens would be saying "Jesus your guys eyes are TERRIBLE". Also I really dont like the fact that we haven't even detected dark matter or proved it's existence yet, that out model of the universe includes something that makes up 85% of it that we can't really account for doesn't sit right with me at all. And why is it fine for mainstream science to make such a big reach but all of our theories are just rubbish?

Picture me coming up with a theory for the 4th dimension but I can't really do the math behind 85% of it or there is a discrepancy of 85%, I'd be absolutely laughed at. That's not to say I think I know better than physicists, I just think it'd be nice if our views werent considered as being so out there when stuff like this is going on.

I flip and flop with the Fermi paradox too, sometimes I agree and think hell yeah where IS the life, yet other times I fully subscribe to either dark forest theory or the fact that the timespan of our existence is like 0.00001 seconds in a day in comparison, I really don't know what to make of it but it's intriguing nonetheless.

As for the flatland take on things, that theory 100% ticks every box for me, I think it honestly really answers pretty much all of the questions or at least a majority and honestly, I think it's sort of a given that something exists in the 4th dimension.

I don't think it's even that much of a problem that we can't see things going on around us, we happily accept that X-rays for example are real and there and can pass through us, why is it suddenly an issues when those exact same properties are used in a theory?

Good post too btw 10/10 would read again.Thanks for the link looks interesting, i agree 100% stuff like wave-particle duality and quantum entanglement absolutely blows my mind and pretty often when I'm reminded of it I end up down a deep rabbit hole of simulation theory/parallel universes etc. 

I think we have so much to learn that we haven't even scratched the surface yet and I also think the holders out in mainstream science are in for a big shock if they don't start at least attempting to roll with the punchesFirst things first, I see what you did there. Excellent work my friend.

Secondly, I just looked over it, it was indeed a lot. I'm that guy you know who's low key just thinking about aliens 24/7 and I'll happily write an essay just as a reply, lord save us all if someone actually invites me to go deep on a subject.I was never really fully on board with how "woo" the phenomena really is.

As in a few years ago I wasn't exactly a full on nuts and bolts guy but I think I was in about the same place that a lot of people in this sub were, not believing UFOs were entirely nuts and bolts, but that they were "sort of" nuts and bolts but maybe had either the old sufficiently advanced magic technology or they were able to manipulate something we weren't.
 
I'm pretty much 100% on board now that what's going on with not just the phenomena, but our existence as a whole has a LOT more to do with "woo" than I previously had ever imagined.

I keep ""ing woo because I don't think it's actually woo any more, I think these theories and concepts that we currently look at as being woo, consciousness, the phenomena leveraging/relying on things we not only don't understand but possibly don't even know exist yet, will eventually be just as hard science as something like electricity, its just the fact that it's such a foreign concept to us at the minute that it seems like some out there hippie dippie stuff, much as im sure the first champions of anything quantum were laughed at: "something can be exist in TWO seperate states at the same time? *cue laughter,*"

To get even deeper, hey you asked OP.

I legit feel kinda sorry for the hardcore remainders in the debunking camp, I don't mention skeptics because j think they have a healthly reasoning system still, but with the amount of evidence that's been brought to light recently their runway is getting mighty short too.

Anyway I don't feel sorry for them in a condescending way, I just mean that by being open to the UFO phenomena, I've opened my mind a lot more to things like woo because of it, it's a knock on effect basically, and while these are personal opinions and I'm not invoking religion YMMV.

I'm now considerably more positive that death is not the end for us, the more I hear/learn/think about topics like consciousness, the more I find myself being convinced that there is a lot, LOT more than we know what's going on, sure, some of it, hell maybe even all of it might be bad, maybe aliens really are keeping us trapped here and feeding off our negative emotions, but if they are, me burying my head in the sand isn't going to change that fact, it's something we're all going to have to face no matter what, given the choice between lying to myself and still being unsure anyway because I know I'm lying to myself and just accepting where I think the data is taking me I'll take the latter 100% of the time.Lord almighty you just gsve me the vision of humans alternating between walking upright and occasionally dropping to all fours and running around like a horse to keep their back healthy lmao*half of humanity returns after wandering the solar system for 20,000 years*

Sorry but you want us to do what?
SHARE?

What all of it? 
Seriously though what do you guys want?
Oh you were being serious?
You want us to SHARE everything?
We'll get back you.

WORLD WAR 3 BEGINS: ALIEN SPACE NAZIS DEMAND RESOURCESI can definitely see the logic behind it and I certainly recognise it as a possible for religion but I woulx sorta disagree too, a lot of the bigger contributors to the king term advancement of our species have been atheist, fully aware they won't live to see the full potential of their work or just doing what they do because they're passionate about it, I honestly think its much more down to genetics, natural or otherwise.

Look at the amount of wasted potential through people shi do what you say and do sit at home and beat off all day, imagine the amount of Einstein's we could have had compared to how many we actually have.

Maybe it's s case of us having the drive instilled in us both genetically AND religion and the concept of and want of an afterlife is also there as a backup/primary source of inspiration as well? It's very possible we outgrow religion, or that it didn't take in the first place unless I'm entirely wrong and the idea was seeded by "something" else, I just feel like a species so advanced would maybe use a much more "reliable" standard like encoding it in our actual being.

I'm not disagreeing for disagreeings sake btw, I actually agree with you to a point, just furthering discussion x)One of the articles linked in this post has 5 million people's fingerprints being checked and 1.4 million DNA samples being checked, I think if you start to look at just an officer running s DNA or fingerprint test or sending then somewhere etc it starts to look probable, especially with numbers this highIt is yeah but I think being an atheist and having it actually confirmed by an authoritative source to be true are two completely different things. 

Furthermore just because someone is an atheist doesn't mean they believe that death is the end, I think actual 100% die hard (pardon the pun) atheists that believe death is the end are going to be very rare. I don't think you could come to that conclusion and have concrete belief in it very easily.

So now imagine that you're being told in no uncertain terms that once you're dead that's it. The /knowing/ is a big part of it, Id venture a guess that a lot of atheists have some small belief in a post death existence or even just a small hope.Bassssssicallllyyyyy though it's the idea that Saturn worship is extremely common and has invaded pretty much every level and part of society, religion, entertainment etc. It's way too much for me to go in to in a reply, Saturn = Satan basically and Saturn worship is super prevelant in freemasonry and all the other fun clubs u aren't in.

^ this is the sub you're looking for.

If you're more of a listening guy there's a dude who does the podcast circuit and delivers a TWO PIECE COMBO of the electric universe AND the saturn worship thing. Just go on Spotify and look for "Saturn death cult" and listening to anything by Troy McLachan.They gained popularity in places like castles because they stopped a mass of troops getting anywhere on a hurry for starters, furthermore if you're ever somewhere real old like a castle/fort take notice of the direction of the staircase, I'll bet you good money it ascends clockwise, this way when you're going up your sword arm (right) is against the centre column and it's much more difficult for you to swing your sword, whereas a defender coming down can swing in a natural arc using his right hand because it's against the open side of the staircase and there's room for his sword to go through. Small side note they also often have odd uneven steps so that the defender's of the castle art familiar with the layout whereas an attacker will be confused and hopefully fall over.

I know they're just sorta associated with royalty too and are a super practical and savvy space saving way of getting stairs into a tall building.Pretty much all of the homeless rely on being around other people to get by though, if you're legit homeless and living on the street chances are you're getting by from the generosity of strangers and a twice daily commute to a motorway to sleep isn't on the cards usually. 

Also I think you would be extremely suprised by how hidden away most homeless are, you don't live in the streets and make a habit of sleeping anywhere even remotely open, you honestly wouldn't believe the nooks and crannies/places that people just wouldn't be near or have no reason to be near, even in a heavily populated city.

I'm also mad confused why this is a conspiracy?https://www.reddit.com/r/HighStrangeness/comments/s7yp0f/new_research_i_attempted_to_solve_these_thirteen/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

I think this is what the guy is trying to reference, it's been done a few times too now, it's pretty damning to say the leastThe ice drift stuff is fascinating and crazy, here's a good explanation and visual that shows another journey over the ice, how much ice drifts per day and how that same journey looks without ice drift. Long story short over a 1500km journey, the same explorers drifted 600km.

Also mad props OP, i love anything Antarctica/arctic related and I'd never heard of this expedition. These guys embodied the not giving a fuck attitude and if it wasn't so tragic it'd be hilarious. Absolute legends.Yea man I've got nothing against it being done for entertainment I just wish the people who were would state that they were, you can't tell me that the people doing these interviews fully believe in everything they put out, it does a lot more harm to the community than people realise because anyone looking into this is going to hit someone like that first and just decide yeah it's a load of make believe and adults pretending werewolves are real.

Brandon was the guy who went out hunting them down too yeah, his first episode was actually pretty believable but then he got his two friends together and went out and killed one, quoting a Kong film and had pictures remotely deleted off his phone by the CIA within 20 minutes. I honestly think it makes an idiot of the host more than anyone else if they're presenting it as factual then they're putting their name behind it behind real and if you can't see through some of these whoppers people are telling then I weep for humanity.Zoolander, apologies my friend it went straight over my head and I had my UFO blinders onSorry but why? We don't even know /what/ "they" are, this could be a 4d being being represented to us in 3d, it could be an alien race who is 5cm's tall or a drone sent from a larger ufo, there is no measure or standard for what a UFO should or shouldn't be, it's unknown by its very name and nature lolBut then if they only really care about power and have the advantage of a unique breakthrough technology on their side why not just so what they want with it and gain all the power and control over people they want? It's clear we can do nothing in defense against the phenomenaThis scenario would also have then participating in yet another absolutely massive cover up that involves s huge amount of money though, I understand that this isn't outside of the realms of possibility but this also assumes that at some point someone has okayed lying to the public on a scale that's pretty much not been proven to have happened yet.

You've got the money that's going missing yearly into black budget that's contributing to this and if we're taking..Roswell? as a starting point, it's been going on a long time and has sucked up a massive amount of money so far, then as stated someone's okayed the lying on a huge scale, to the public constantly, the news, congress, congress in public via the latest meetings, I can't really see this being justifiable, even for the "greater good" when it's something you're just holding back for s rainy day hoping for a situation that will be so drastic the public would be fine about it.

And what about other "breakthrough" technology, why is something like stealth development only secret to the point that we eventually find out one way or another? How was it tested completely in secret? Surely there was stop-starts. It took Boeing something like 140 engine redesigns to get one of their major airlines off the ground, (might have been the 747 but I'm not 100% sure on model).

Would there not be a huge incentive to let the technology drip down into the commercial market? As you said energy generation, solving hunger etc, all pretty lucrative fields.

I'm not trying to piss on your bonfire either and being the always sceptic, I appreciate open minded discussion and like taking part in it so please don't think I'm just throwing out counter points, I'd just be interested in hearing your thoughts on these points, (I actually think the governments of the world can't lie straight in bed).Definitely not I'm afraid. Foreign objects are such a large risk to aviation that you can't even have a boot in your hand inside a hangar without there being paperwork to prove where it came from, who had it in their hand, at what time and where it ended up. 

There is literally no way that flight path was okayed for anyone. 

I don't believe it's an amateur either, other than it being the kind of crime that is 100% landing you in jail you can guarantee there was an AWACS above the show for the entirety and more electronic counter measures on the area than you could shake a stick at.Depending on distance and some other factors, like it actually being a message from a civilization, there's the possibility that that civilization wouldn't even exist any more. 

Or maybe it does and we reply, but don't worry about a reply, there's every possibility it won't arrive in your lifetime.

As a small aside though, the "lack" of life around us can be looked at as us being an atom of a grain of sand on an infinitely large beach that's been self aware for 0.001seconds and can see its nearest neighbour to a distance of 1micrometer around it, deciding there is a lack of intelligent life in the universe.

Humanity is a ridiculously small pinprick on the infinitely large scale of the universe, when we look at how long we've been intelligent ourselves just Vs the length of time the universe has been around and it's size, it's mind boggling, it brings up all sorts of interesting tangents; the femri paradox and it's counter arguments (a great reset/wall, dark forest theory etc), really is fascinating imo.Imo, dogman encounters post Brandonish~. I didn't say because I don't want to start soapboxing but I think it had credibility to begin with as a lot of the encounters just seemed really genuine, but around the time again, I think, when he started running thin on people to interview his vetting standards seem to have gone down a bit.I don't mean to be harsh OP and it's fine if you believe it in my book I just think the problem with this particular channel is he's shall we say, had "dubious" guests before and that can really sour folks opinion of someone even if its just the once, I'd suggest looking at this channel as for entertainment only, along with a certain other well known channel, when someone is putting out this type of content consistently as if they have people lining up to tell their stories I think it's worth asking a question or two.

I've looked at the channel before fyi and what I struggled with was that every other video was something like "posting proof tomorrow' or "photos will be uploaded in a day or two" yet we have still have no proof. The content itself has escalated in drama at a consistent rate which is another major red flag for me. If he was putting out videos once a week and just saying "hey guys look nothings came in but I've been looking so were just going to go over some old cases" etc it'd have a more serious feel to it. The way it's structured is very clearly for entertainment imo and a lot of people in this sub aren't strictly looking for entertainment and are also extremely used to being given the runaround.

This isn't an attack on you or the channel posted, just trying to rationalize why you might not get the response you expect from people sometimes because a lot of us are naturally sceptical but *want to believe*, which is pretty much the case across a lot of the high strangeness subs.I'd be curious to know if there's ever been a demonstration on something like a steel ingot? Why is it always spoons and cutlery which by their design are pretty easily bent anyway? Surely if it's the intention and the metal can be bent by will then this would be possible with something completely solid?You're funny my guy and your editing is enjoyable too, Ill sub, keep it up x)War never changes eyI think a lot of it can come from forming that opinion through a combination of people like Valle's work where it's pointed out that the phenomena has over time /possibly/ showed signs of deception, (it'd appearance kinds changing over time to match cultural ideas, yes I know this is s bit spotty), the bible saying that the devil is the prince of the air and their actual activities and MO, abductions can be a very frightening and negative prospect depending on your state of mind and to be honest just in general, and the fact that aliens are apparently masking their identity etc.

A lot of people also interpret the Bible's description of aliens as being old times depictions of UFO's and there's other events in the bible that could be looked as as being UAP and abductions.That's interesting, the aviation industry is a strange one as a whole, there's all this money in it but then there's s huge shortage of staff (maintenance tech mostly) thats a sort of self fulfilling prophecy and in a roundabout way is it's own cause, I can see that being a big factor tbh, them not having staff on hand for example, the staff are in a much better position in that industry to say no to employers demands, especially ones outside their work scope of might just do it and either willingly or unwillingly through lack of training/enthusiasm not do the best job.

The lack of access to experts is the same old story unfortunately, from people retiring early to an exodus of people leaving aviation and moving to other fields, again it's usually engineers but then who is going to be more knowledgeable when it comes to getting safe operating tolerances/information on how these systems work etc, I have to agree it's extremely concerning.If you're *sure* this isn't a false memory and judging by your upvotes I'm leaning towards it not being, then I'm *sure* someone recorded the original stream. This was too big, especially considering this community has had basically nothing from the government for 50 years, all you have to do now is find that recording! I'll look on YouTube myself too and if I find one I'll come back and DM you a link 

Seriously the community is too anal to have let this slide.

I have to question though, is that how any part of declassification works? It sounds really... amteurish? for him to have just declared he declassified it?

Then again after watching the VLC performance I guess I wouldnt put it past them either.Heath and safety is generally a 2 sided thing, the official way it should be done is standardised across industries, so if you want to look at say how Boeing's engineers SHOULD be working you can just look up the official health and safety standards for that country, be it the OHSA, or the HSE whatever it is, standard operating procedures are public, how they're actually applied and treat/respected in an individual factory is another matter entirely.

As an example there's a process of locking off machinery to make it safe to work on which at its most basic level is just putting a padlock onto a power switch of the machinery you're working on so it can't be turned on maintenance. If you're doing this by the book everything around it is usually turned off as well because you're not just isolating that specific machine, it's also sometimes important to stop the flow of electricity to it, but as you can imagine that can be costly to production and isn't a favourite of production managers, so depending on where you're working the safety protocol can range from "shut everything down and do it properly" to "wow don't be a tryhard just put some barrier tape up and work around the machine so you aren't costing us money"

It's pretty sad tbh because health and safety is often treated lackadaisical until someone loses a hand, THEN it's done by the book, all I can say is that attitudes probably aren't the way you'd imagine, it's often small independent companies that care about their staff working safely and faceless corporations with production managers chasing numbers telling their staff to "just get it done".

At the end of the day you're fully entitled to do what you want to make your work environment safe within h+s advice and if you got fired over that a tribunal would eat your employer alive, however that can also paintsl a target on your back and you might find your work ethic and production being much more closely monitored that the guy next to you who is happy to risk a hand to chase an extra 20 minutes of production.Typically you have a near miss and fill out a form with the specifics (where was I/what was I doing/time/etc) and hand it in to whatever department handles it, they then investigate what happened and try to either remove the risk entirely (best case), if that's not possible then they'll try less and less "effective" measure's, maybe replace something, i.e my near miss was caused because something overheated, so it gets replaced with something with a higher flashpoint or temperature tolerance, if that's not possible then they might try to reduce your exposure to the risk, i.e (I nearly hit a goose; spend less time in areas with geese) all the way down to admitting you can't control the risk and providing the person at risk with personal protective equipment, (helmet, flight goggles etc). 

So basically a process of remove > replace > reduce > protect. It's from this that people say that PPE is the "last line of defence" for someone, because everything previous was tried (the R's) and couldn't be done so we accepted the risk and provided PPE.

Also what you're saying about cars is essentially something implemented by this system so you're right it's a part of it yes.

Someone had a car crash, can we remove the chance of it happening? No, but we can reduce the chance of it happening by installing a collision detection system. x)I'd imagine that would be very difficult because the variables are so broad a spectrum it'd be hard to have any consistency to reports imo, near miss systems are usually in place as as risk reduction/removal system.

I don't doubt they're treat very differently when it involves UAP but I'd were to believe the extent of near misses is 11 it's not really enough data that I can imagine being able to group it under different headings without having 11 seperate headings.

Then again I don't really believe a lot of what I've just heard so.It's not a set distance, a near miss is "an event that had the potential to cause harm but did not" as I'd explain it.

I.e a missile was on a collision course with an aircraft that was 80 miles away, until 70 miles away it had NOT been informed it was on a collision course, this is a near miss as much as "goose flew by 10 foot away"Fraud so it's classified buddy, small club you're not in it etc sorryWe already knew there'd be a closed part, call it what you will but at the end of the day there's always going to be classification problems with something like thisThank you very much, I was just using the ffbe wikis rating and saw queen, sieg and LL squall were all ranked pretty high, I got a dupe squall and ive still got about 150 tickets to run through including my guaranteed NV unit one and UOC ticket, it's a lot to catch up with but I've watched a few YouTube videos and read around too, I just wanted some input on my units to make sure I wasn't overlooking anyone as the system is really complex now compared to what it was, much obliged though friend x)Alright thank you, I've actually got a lone lion squall, so make a team of 6 NV units then? So far im looking at using sieghared/queen, LLsquall and I'll find a tank breaker and healer? Am I along the right tracks? Frankly I'm overwhelmed by the amount of new summon boxes, it used to be 5 max, same with events tbh, do the events stay open now unless they say limited time..(same for summons?), Also I've got a select unit ticket, are they still mad rare? I'm considering saving it until I hit a wall because I've got more than enough lapis and tickets from comp to keep me going for now.

Thanks again, I know some of these are probably stupid questions but it's a very different game from when I left.

Edit: my bad I didn't have the dates below my events, I had to download data and it's updated so I can see the dates.Hey guys, I haven't played for s good few years, I was a day 1 player and I've occasionally logged in over the last few years and pulled, so I've got about 100? 5* bases, I just wondered if someone would point out the better performers for me? I don't expect anyone to make a team or anything, just to point me in the right direction, I'd really appreciate it.

https://imgur.com/a/LffcLXeI know it was a failure my point is that it was demo'ed in 1959 which was 60 years ago, I was just hoping to get some opinions on how it might have been a launching off point for a modern day undertaking if it a) wasn't as unsuccessful as was shown to the public and b) the project was never canned anyway, i pointed out in the captions that flyby has a dome on the top that looks like a viewing port/360 window which seems really like something we would have added to an aircraft. I was just trying to elicit some discussion lolI understand that but I still feel like it's just more of th same still, the issue has never been the public wanting the government to start handling reports seriously and to take action on them, the major issue remains exactly the same as always, we want to know what those in the know actually know and were sick of being told "we aren't ready" or that it'd "rock the boat too much", if it does then so be it.

I just feel like all of this distracts from that issue and let's people look better in their public image, it gives them an opportunity to be like "oh look were sharing this and were been fully transparent about it so you don't need to worry", they're solving an issue that was never a problem.

I understand it's a seperate issue and it's nice to have it addressed, but it wouldn't be an issue at all if the original major issue was addressed.If you mean the first it's from a well known video from these parts known as FLYBY I just grabbed a screenshot of.

The second is a picture of the Avrocar VZ9, have a look on YouTube, its a VTOL "flying saucer" which i assure you is/was real x)SS: Was watxhing the FLYBY video recently and it really reminded me of this early attempt at a man made flying saucer, seems like a few things add up here,  FLYBY could very likely be recorded by an escort on a test flight, as it's really close, matching speed and really good quality and lastly and most possibly the most suggesting to be, is the dome on the top that really looks intended as a viewing port/360 window, which I really cant imagine something like a tic tac having to be honest.

It's flight characteristics really look like something that Avrocar could have become after a few decades of work, apparently the project was scrapped but there's reasons I don't believe this.

Even if the footage is fake and im flat out wrong, I still find it really interesting that we were able to get something like this in the air as early as the 60s and to me at least really makes me wonder what we can get into the air nowadays.Notice what he actually says though, theyre looking forward to being as transparent as possible with their "new" process on *processing uap reports, analysing the information and sharing their OPINION on the phenomena*, all I get from this is "we haven't been taking this seriously in the last (lie) (..oh and also that means w don't actually have much data up to now) (another lie) and were going to be working with the public and showing the public their own reports on UAP and our opinions on these reports".

I understand it's nice it's being taken more seriously but this is just more of the same again. This isn't a dig at OP more a reminder that this is probably the prevalent attitude amongst those fighting back still, and that is: if we are going to need to be transparent going forward then we will pretend to work with the public but share nothing we have learned so far.

I really hope the pressure keeps up and we can keep applying it as a group as well until we can beat this attitude out of them and get some answers because this is beyond ridiculous now.If you have access to where she's living now might be worth scanning the FM band where she's living and also scanning Bluetooth/network addresses and seeing if you can pin them all down?That is odd then, I was thinking along the lines of her actually having another Bluetooth capable device that had been connecting or trying to connect to it but it's a bit of a stretch to be honest, sounds more likely it's due to the radio bands if I had to guess but it's odd regardlessHmm, is there any Bluetooth capabilities in it? Have you tried scanning for devices where she used to live or checking any of her other electronic devices if you can to see it there's anything that could have connected to it and used it's audio capabilities?

Edit; I'm also not suggesting that the explanation is something so simple I'm just suggestinf some easily ruled out causes x)Is it possible that venito cristo is one of the preloaded voice clips in another language? Like it might be Italian for "device ready" etc?It's a honeypot operation!He has I'm afraid, it's actually a relatively common way that old painters represented the sun and the moon. It's nowhere near unique to these few paintings and is in fact in quite a lot, however the first or second one posted with Mary where the UFO is over her right shoulder looks very much like a UFO in an old painting. Sorry to be a party pooper and allIn the slowed down version the entity actually appears before the boys hand is down signifying the start of the video, his hand is up in the air, the thing appears, THEN his hand drops and the video/live starts, but the entity doesn't loop or move back or anything, makes it look like two seperate videos overlayed on top.Okay well Paul Sinclair has been on loads of other podcasts and pushes a book series called truth proof too, he talks about dogmen a lot but he also discusses other phenomena that occur in these areas.

Josh turner runs paranormal round table and there's any amount of dogman material on there.

Like I said I'd really recommend branching out from DER, i feel like Vic felt he needed to be putting out an episode a week and it's strayed more into "entertainment" imo, dogman specific shows/channels are a bit niche really, the two above and Joedy Cooke are about as "serious" as you're going to find on the subject but all three have been on a lot of other shows.

Expanded perspectives on Spotify also like their upright canines but their show is more general paranormal again x) best of luck buddy

https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCBg4xzFar583zoFZ_ReiQTg/videos

^ that's Paul Sinclair's channel, 10s of hours of content there and the UK stuff is intriguing as all hell, he talks about places like hunmandby (the farmstead of the HOUNDMAN) and the flixton werewolf, the area is rife with werewolf lore so dive in ladJust to contribute too sorry OP I got sidetracked and forgot to reply to you x(

If you go onto Spotify or whatever you use and search for "Dave leidy" all his DER episodes come up, he's an investigator for the north American dogman project and is pretty legit. 

Look for Paul Sinclair as well, based in England but does some really good work and there's actually a lot more folklore in England around these than you might think

Look up Josh turner again DER and his episodes will all come up again.

Also go to the north American dogman project website (just Google it) and they have a link to their YouTube channel on their main page, it's ran by Joedy cook and he takes it really seriously too. 

Also all these names above have appeared on multiple podcasts and are all IMO pretty legit anyway, hit me back if you struggle and I'll get you the episode numbers, just personal opinion but they're all "researchers" so they're vetting people themselves and it adds a little bit of credibility in my book x)Turns out I am yes dunno where I got episode 50 from, I agree with you too I was saying i personally feel like it adds more credence to her story, I get that she'd come across Vic pretty early on but what would she have to gain is what I mean, if she was going to lie about something like this I'd expect her to maybe contact a local or German group and try to gain something from that, I think everything is in her favour, it just seems really unlikely to me that someone would invent this whole elaborate story to tell on a radio show in another country she's probably never going to go to, I just got the impression she was a nice normal German woman who was house sitting for someone, if she is lying it just seems like a really strange scenario, that someone would make contact with someone internationally just to spin a yarn? It's a lot of effort to go to for absolutely 0 gain so it inclines me to believe it actually happened and she just wanted to talk about it or get it out thereI feel like there's two camps of people with DER and that is people who listened up to and stopped at Brandon because they thought it was ridiculous and everyone else, that's not to say I'm proclaiming im "in the right here either", I just feel like the show went seriously downhill after him and Vic wasn't vetting people like,. At all anymore.

For me the most believeable are the guy with the muscle car who saw one rounding a corner, it had "cherry bomb mufflers" and if u know u know.

Befor that around episode 50 or 60 there was a German woman who saw one through a glass wall of her home, just seemed so random, makes you think why would a middle aged woman from Germany decide to make this up and get in contact with someone in America to discuss it with? A lot of the fanbase is in America/ not in Germany so yeah.

Also all of Josh turner's episodes I found really convincing and were a breath of fresh air for the show because it was a nice step away from the usual format. 

I just can't take Brandon seriously after his last two episodes, it just seemed like he was out to prove how much of a Billy bad ass he was in them, no ones ever managed to down one and he kills it? Then the men in black hack his phone remotely on the way back from a wooded area and delete pictures of it? I mean come on seriously? Plus he was supposedly absolutely run down and he still manages to outpace a pack of them which were scared to get the drop on him because he had a gun? By all intents and purposes these things are a) masters of stealth or capable of moving in a way we aren't aware of, b) absolute apex predators and c) pack hunters, his first two episodes alone were a lot to swallow but he would have gotten away with it imo if he'd stopped there, going and hunting them down and dropping catchphrases while he did it is too much of a first into the absolute farcical for me in afraid.I understand this thought process and obviously these are pretty big assumptions to make but I feel like the aliens would grow distrustful of the military pretty quickly,  I think that if a civilization has advanced technologically to the point of being able to visit other planets in a reasonable time then their entire species has eventually pulled together and would possibly view the fact that the militarys of earth have so much power and control as a really bad thing.

If this scenario came about I can 100% see the majority of people who have a say in this doing everything they can to keep it under wraps and within their own control permanently, probably under the guise of "national security" or just constantly claiming we weren't ready and a panic would be caused.

I really feel/hope aliens would just get tired of the militarys shit and just turn around and say 'yeah it'd cause a massive panic still because you guys aren't telling anyone shit". I fully believe the military has known UFOs weren't anything we were responsible for for an absolute bare minimum of 60 years and I also find it hard to believe that anyone seriously believed that this could be kept under wraps indefinitely, so they've already had a minimum of 60 years and counting.

If disclosure comes about the very last people responsible for it will be the military.The biggest clue it's fake that the ears don't move, hell even a domestic house cats ears are like a pair of radar dishes, sure you can argue it's focusing it's attention forward but any predator like thst would have its ears rotated to cover at least somewhere to its side or behind it, realistically it's ears might be focused fully forward for a second but then they're going back on a permanent swivel, I don't believe they'd been both be fully forward even if it was focusing in front of it, they'd be rotated so they were aimed away from the door at a 45degree angle. 

Its mouth doesn't move either, it's from tiktok, the lighting is set up perfectly so it's half illuminated and you can't see what's going on, and if the howl is supposed to be genuine, one of the most elusive things on the planet (assuming it exists) wouldn't creep to somewhere then start firing off like an air raid siren advertising its presence.

So yah, personally I don't think it's real."cloud seeding"Happy cake day friend x)If anyone knows the date or of its down as unsolved i have a pretty good idea of what these end of the world sounds are, in short it's construction. If this comment gains any traction I'll edit it and write out a full post but Ive done this exact same thing before AND wrote out full posts and neither get any attention so I feel like I'm urinating into the wind.Oh wow the wiki page has made some serious progression, I remember this always being a big thing on 4chan, it seems a bit more mysterious to me I guess because I was looking at it from a pre whenever all this was found out point of view, there used to be a list of like 4 or 5 messages that had been broadcast on it the entire time it had been running, including one where the mic was accidentally left on, which kinda of suggested it was permanently manned, interesting that theres been such an uptick in its activity and that itself might be worth looking into, when exactly did it start being so much more active/ what major world events or events involving the eastern bloc specifically happened around tbr the same time. Just some food for thought but I'll have a look myself too because I'm clearly years behind the curve here.Actuslly you do, anyone can listen to uvb-76, that specific station is said to be anything from a dead hand component to something that gives messages to spy's, I've heard the few broadcasts it's made too so I know recordings exist of some of those, iirc there was pretty much 0 activity on it till recently (think within 10/15 years recently), but yeah, you can listen to it online, don't get too excited though it is what it sounds like, a continuous buzzing lolIce heard a few stories here and there where they were, I guess i sort of assume they do with the whole wolf thing but I dunno, I sort of sometimes feel like theyre something else taking on that form tbhDunno, depends if the wolfman is a flesh and blood entity or not I guess? If it isn't I'd have my money on the wolf man tbh"the greater good", if they came out and announced that there were 8 foot bipedal wolves roaming around there would be demands for safety, then what if they came out and said "oh btw we can't actually harm them", human beings can't even trust each other let alone werewolves lulz, then you've also got well if x is real then what about y and even more public panic. I know some people are open minded and happy to hear news like this but the fact is the majority aren't and it'd rock the boat way too muchI think you all missed the part where he said he's in sao pauloI don't mean to sound rude or negative op but there's already a hell of a lot of trading bits out there, both free and paid for, it sounds like this is going to be a lot of hassle for you and you could end up disappointed in the outcome, unless of course you have a USP, but if you did then running it with s site as s front end wouldn't be an issue.

You've done well to to get to where you are in the time you have so I would just suggest continuing to polish up on your skills and looking for freelance work instead, then you don't have this range of things to worry about, again though I know nothing about what you've put together, just trying to save you a little stress and make a friendly suggestion. x)I'm from the UK and while they do have entertaining articles the daily mail is the rag of all rags, frequent spelling errors, articles aren't even near being fact checked, very controversial articles and subjects purely for clicks/buys/views, would never take anything from them seriously without at least one more source from a MUCH more reputable paper backing it up.It doesn't, when I posted saying it was strange that it worked I'd opened a terminal myself and just tried to put a date in with a T in the same place and it worked fine, but when I tried it again on the CSV files column it spat out the same error again, i don't understand why fromisoformat() won't won't in this specific CSV file, I can only guess it has something to do with the blank spaces and the way this file was put together

Edit to add: my excel knowledge is about as strong the claw machine at an arcades but it's something to do with the way the date and time is written, if I delete the two blank spaces at the start of the date/time cell the date disappears and only the time remains, but the date is still visible at the text box at the top so yeah I havent got a clue what's going on thereKay so when I went into excel in the original file the date and time was formatted properly in the cell (aligned left) but when I clicked the actual cell the text bar at the top of excel was saying there was 2 blank spaces at the start of the date/time cell, so I used
 
datetime.strptime(row[4], '     %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f')

And it finally took the dates. So yeah I had to use cntrl + H in excel to find and replace every T in the original CSV files date and time column and then had to make sure to include the 2 blank spaces at the beginning of the string, just figured I'd post this in case anyone else comes across this post.Hmm so it does, I'm going to see if I can find the original CSV again and have a look again bc I'm curious nowI was just using a for loop to read the row and used
date = datetime.fromisoformat(row[4]).

ValueError: Invalid isoformat string: '2019-12-24T23:05:21.392'

I've replied to my own post with how I've worked round it though, regardless thank you very much for the input x)Well I should have tried what I suggested here first I guess lol, went into excel and selected every cell in the column, cntrl + H brings up "find and replace" so I just replaced the character T with a blank space so put the gap in and format it the way I wanted it.Hmm still giving a ValueError, I'm guessing this stupid T is the root of the problem so I think I'm going to see if I can find something to strip the letter out of the CSV file itself, I appreciate the heads up on the iso function though, definetly worth knowing x)Hey guys don't really want to make a new thread because it's not deathly important.

Anyway I'm importing data from a CSV file and I'm trying to pull the dates in using strptime() but the date is formatted in the file as: %Y-%m-%d T %H:%M:%S. 

An example is 2019-12-24T23:05:21

 The T is the actual letter T that has been put in to mean "time" obviously but im getting a ValueError because I can't get the T to match anything. 

I've tried a few different arguments here like timezone, date abbreviation etc, I just wondered if there is a way to tell strptime() to expect to see a string or could I somehow get it to take the date in regardless with a try/except/else block? 

Thanks guys : )I have a feeling this has come from LE leaning on chadwellvor someone else, perhaps KK himself because they strongly suspected KK knew something that could lead to serious developments, theres a good reason they didn't arrest him when they first picked him up I think and that they possibly thought if they did arrest him and started putting the pressure on publicly they thought it would spook BG way too much and then he really would vanish vanish.

It's all speculation at this point but I personally don't think it's anywhere near 100% that KK is BG.

They could have been waiting on a strong tip from Kline thinking he knew a lot more about the case but their hand has been forced somehow, I just think it's so sad that that the girls were so clever to do what they did and it hasn't lead to the case being solved, I just really want to see BG brought to justice and everything expressed is my personal opinion, I by no means class myself as a sleuth or anything related.Humper monkeys ghost story

It's creepypasta but bear with me here. It's set in a secluded army barracks on a mountain, heavy snowfall and the cold is very prominent to the story and it's been published into a book now too. It was originally posted up to the something awful forums and s lot of people besides me highly recommend it.

It can be read for free here, along with the sequels which are just as good, if not better imo.

 http://nothotbutspicy.com/para/hm/

Honestly don't judge it on being free or internet published, it's in a league of its own.The nazis had a pretty big hard on for the occult in general, i THINK it was mostly an SS thing but there's a lot of stories out there regarding it, that they wete interested is a fact, however actually finding reliable/sourced/ttue stories id another issue entirely. It should scratch the itch regardless though.Yeah I agree, they do a herculean amount of work, when climbers are at camp 4 (South side) or camp 5 or 6 on the North they're literally like "I was attempting to summit in the morning so when I heard a GUNSHOT outside my tent I just rolled over and went back to sleep", I know they need the energy but it's almost comical. In the early days they were taking even funnier shit up there like 120 tins of duck pate. I find it all really funny tbh.To be fair there's cases where people have collapsed and LINES of people are stepping over them, sometimes it isn't just a case of sharing oxygen and even when it is, each climber is only carrying what they NEED.

Additionally the energy spent trying to help someone could/would probably result in both of them dying, the name of the area is literally "the death zone"

I cns understand why you disagree with people saying "Well I paid X amount of money" because it really shows they have a kind of poor set of morals, but in essence they're making the right choice for themselves at the same time, it's really not as simple as just helping someone down the mountain.

On a more positive (sort of) note, I recall reading about a climber who found a woman dying, she'd sat down and basically if someone has sat down and allowing for the fact that they know the rules of mountaineering, she knew she was going to die essentially, anyway, the guy ended up sitting with her and sharing some of his oxygen with her until she passed which I found to be kinda nice, that someone at least had the decency to stop and be with her in her final moments, even if it meant him turning around.Aydyyn, pronounced, ay-dying.It doesn't really involve creatures but roadside picnic is kinda really along those lines, the video game series STALKER is based on it and there's an old film that is kinda loyal to it too, it's more like "environmental" horror but it's a really good read.

Alao the southern reach trilogy is along these lines too, not radiation per say per se? (help), but again it's pretty easy to imagine that the issues faced in the book have been caused by radiation, lot of generally weird high strangeness going on it.Jeff Long - the descent, there's a sequel too called deeper.

Its setcin real life in earth where we discover hell isn't just a fictional place.This is one of my all time favourites, I don't know why either but the constant >!NEVILLE!< thing was hilarious imoEvery second they goes by without teleportation means we are constantly moving closer to teleportation. So yes.Oh wow I didn't even see that, I apologise to the guy I replied to originally then and shall delete my post in shameHopefully this will finally put to bed, as stated what is and isn't on the phone, imo I can't see it being a case of them turning around and saying oh yeah we have a huge segment of BG talking we're just holding it back.

If they really did have better pictures or audio that they could release to the public, then SURELY with the FBI and countless other agencies and officers/ detectives years of experience they would have.

I understand holding back unique things that only someone who committed the crime would know, but holding back a load of extra/clean/or even unclear audio and or images? No, I just can't really imagine it even just using my own common sense.

I'm intrigued as I say but I can't imagine anything new, major or groundbreaking coming from it, I'll happily hold my hands up if im wrong though, but if I am it would seriously put a dent in my faith for how this case has been handled.I Lql10A collective sigh of relief is breathed through r/mystery.... Thank god.This needs to stop, this board isn't your personal blog yet for the last few days you've treated it as such, with threads going, I got a message that days come to the lake, I'm going to the Lake, I'm on my way to the Lake, I'm nearly at the lake, among MANY others, even if this was an interesting subject or mystery no one would be by now after you shit posting about 20 threads. Just keep it to one thread so that those of us who don't care don't need to look at a front page of threads created entirely by you.$confirm /u/CHRIS_L86 $116.56Be that as it may and I don't thibk it's even that obvious tbh, it's pretty significant for a number of reasons, firstly I know we all know and appreciate reddit has been a platform where agendas are pushed etc I don't think people realised how deep that cut ran, like mayhe people could understand upvote bots or accounts with farmer karma, but admins being the ones manipulating things takes it to a new, and deeper level.

Additionally the fact that people are going to lengths to remove any discussion of it shows another level of "corruption", again I know and aprreciate that things are monitored here, but to out right remove any mention of it is pretty damning to say the least, I know the general reply will be "oh well what do you expect them to do, let people sit around slagging them?", and no, I don't, but I would at least hope they would remain neutral, to allow the discussion to go on instead of deleting/removing it, even if it means them sitting there thinking oh well games up they're onto us, that's at least better than trying to censor people.Now I'm no sherlock holmes type, but if I had to guess I'd say its possibly from her brother, I've made a couple of leaps and bounds here which I'd be happy to elaborate on if you want.No one in their right mind would argue that, that's just business, the implication was that its given to certain threats so that THEY make the front page and thus either pushing an agenda, giving bias towards certain companies or views or products or being paid to do so in an adverting fashion. Your point will have taken place since the inception of gold and hardly anyone at all will have had a problem with it, if the gilded posts or threads were random that would be fine.If you mean the Russian thing,..

[puppies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_laboratory_of_the_Soviet_secret_services)

The poison laboratory of the soviet secret services lmao, I guess it does what it says on the tin.The controversial one that got deleted was that mods or admins have unlimited gold that they give out to posts to help them get to the front page.

There was also some guy talking about a Russian laboratory or some secret place where theyd been experimenting on humans, he said about how the last time he'd mentioned it, it'd gotten so many up votes and it'd been deleted or removed, not sure if his new comment stands or not but it's food for thought.

Welp, wish me luck guys.Well just completely disregarding what I said, being able to see the guy more clearly, his face and HAIR specifically has changed the game a lot, people previously believed he had a hat on due to the images released, assumed he was older and didn't believe fully he was old, but some did and he kinda looked it, this video has changed a lot of what we took as knowledge, age, build, clothing, so for these reasons alone it has done a hell of a lot of good.As we've been told to focus on the gait, or so I remember reading in one of these releases? (please correct me if I'm wrong) I know he's not walking as he normally would because he's walking on a bridge he has to be careful on, but he has a very strange way of lifting his legs that looks almost robotic, he lifts them in a very pronounced way that I honestly thing would carry over into his daily walk, take a look at how he raises his legs and the knee action, it almost looks like hes doing a monty python walk or something as stupid as it sounds, his knee/hip action is very off and it wouldn't surprise me to hear he's had some sort of serious back/hip/leg injury at some point which has led to his almost awkward walk.I've been itching to recommend: The Reality dysfunction by Peter F Hamilton, it absolutely fits the bill for what you're looking for and has a sort of mass effect vibe to it, it's a big thick space opera book focusing on quite a few different characters, one is a wreck scavenger, another a captain of a space ship working for a nations space fleet, the variety is huge and im really enjoying it, I was initially put off by the size of the book, but I can't put it down now.Level 28. I'm about half way to level 29 rn.I read a lot and just write small little book reviews, I actually try to maintain quality and do my best. I'll also follow you back just going to get some sleep first.

[@pandammonia_](https://www.instagram.com/pandammonia_)If only we had a subreddits specifically for ARG's... We could even call it something really simple, perhaps just even r/ARGI really would, it's hard to even explain but if you tried to convince someone to read it by explaning it they'd just look at you like an idiot, "so it's 500 pages of some guys talking about mountains? Yep. " okay buddy maybe next year"If the killer really did write that letter it's actually one of the most deplorable thing I've ever read, he sounds like a small child who knows he's getting away with something naughty and it was clearly written 100% for his or her own benefit.

It comes across as "hi killed ur husband REALLY GUILTY sorry, you'll get over it in time tho xx"

Absolutely pathetic and one of the more cowardly things I've seen. $bid im UK based and use it frequently myself anyway Just so OP knows and to defend myself as I'm not some sort of freak, I'd avoid Google images, I had a look there for you and there IS graphic photos of both her body and the autopsy within the first few pages, those came up purely from looking for "black dahlia".

It's not a blanket cure but I'd suggest turning on Google safe search, it actuslly does a pretty good job of cleaning up your search results. The first time I read the OP I thought it said "every day he hung himself" but he was too frail to do so and I was just thinking wat, surely he must have got lucky eventually... "Attempt #52,586, I managed to tie the extension cord to the rafter, but alas, it was far too tiring and I needed to take a nap, oh well, tomorrow is another day". $confirm When it's the other way it usually ends up in the floor/on the microwave bottom and you gotta scoop it up and all sorts of nasty shit gets in it.

Bad dum tsshhI am actually yes, sorry had 300 notifications lelHeres the [TL:DR](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ab/74/62/ab7462d049ba2e75b44aaf960b291dfd.jpg)

Edit: keyboard betrayed me. Twice.I don't know how someone who protects the country, someone who upholds law and order, someone who saves lives on a daily basis and someone who educates our kids even DARES sit around a Metadata production and dissemination co-ordinator without even REALISING that their disgustingly small job titles are making someone feel out of place. Paging r/rimjob_steveNo worries I will just have to wait for the month with another so anything around that I would be happy to do a deal with you on my videos still tho if you want to be a pest i could you please let me know what you have in mind. I have attached my resume for your reference and hope to hear from you soon as I am currently working on the same page because I have been working on the same page because I have been working on the same page because I have been. Fuck me that *looks* desolate, imagine walking through there knowing that it's entirely possible it's the last place you're going to see. I was about to reference this, again im not trying to start an argument or anything I was just throwing an opinion out there, but this "event" sprang to mind and a few other subreddits that are focused on some unsolved cases where a lot of the content/posts can actually be pretty ghoulish or just blatant speculation that doesn't really help at all, it's actually pretty annoying seeing posts by people claiming to want to help who seem more interested in knowing the state of bodies, methods used to kill people etc, I think it can be pretty easy sometimes to disassociate a case from its real life presence and people often forget that behind these crimes theres a family of people and friends who these things can affect.

I can't imagine anything worse than having a loved one disappear and then seeing an online community where a large amount of content is people playing guess work about as I said earlier, ghoulish details, which even knowing would serve little purpose.

Just to triple clarify im not trying to argue or even criticise anyone and I understand that group work can and is helpful in some cases, as I said it's just an opinion and I'm just tryna have a discussion : ) Yah I don't disagree and this isn't a pot shot at this sub, it's more with other places in mind, but i think it's important to realise that there's a line that can be pretty easily crossed in amateur sleuthing, and also to point out that this woman was actually proactive about what she did, actually getting out and searching, fundraising etc, a lot of people who armchair detective on the internet can actually do a lot more harm than good, and it can also get to the point of being wasted time and pointless speculation.

Its nice to see someone who was actually active though and it serves as a good reminder that there's other ways to help out in these cases other than basically trying to solve crimes/identify perps on the net.Outside of what someone else mentioned, the perpetrator having some sort of power or control over someone, I strongly doubt anyone is covering for this guy, it's pretty obvious what the repercussions are of covering for a crime of this magnitude, but even supposing this person was unaware of the legal kickback, it would play with basically anyone, who isn't some sort of sadist/killer themselve's, morality/state of mind/conscience etc.

Personally if I knew someone had done something like the guy has done, and he didn't have control over me, I'd be both disgusted and probably afraid of what he was capable of doing next, the guy killed 2 young girls, knowing that and feeling safe around him are pretty much 2 exclusive things. OP seemingly has infinite amounts of knowledge about both ARG and how the message is encrypted [x] 

OP is claiming it isn't his, but actually his friends [x]

Mysterys solved bois wrap 'er up. watSerious question having read the thread, suppose for a moment they aren't some species of undiscovered cephalapod, how exactly do mermaids reproduce? Is there any consistent sightings of mermen? Would they lay eggs or give live birth? Breast feed or catch small fish? Are mermaids mammals or fish?

Edit: a wordHave you considered trying to find some old blueprints or even newer ones, pretty sure if there was a substructure at your school it would need to be on them, even if its closed down, so long as its actually acknowledged to be real. Have you considered trying to find some old blueprints or even newer ones, pretty dhre if there was a substructure at your school it would need to be on them, even if its closed down, so long as its actually acknowledged to be real. It does, you just dont understand it. Can someone explain this joke for me please? Like i understand it must be based on a pun or its a play on words but i just dont get it, i think im lacking the capacity. I dont mean to sound condescending but wouldn't it be a lot stranger if a deer carcass in the woods HADNT been chomped on? Jet fuel can melt a steel beam. What's the deal with the voices OP? You stated creation wasn't capable of voice acting or creating human voice,. Is it an oversight or is something more sinister going on? Actually yeah that'd be amazing, can I have a little think? I'll only want a few 1 things here and there I won't take the proverbial. Thank you though I really appreciate it. Ivs got an appointment with someone at the CAB this Wednesday and I was on anti depressants a while back but I eventually stopped them because the side effects and how they generally made me feel were disagreeable, I've been through CBT and a few other things before and personally I find things will clear up eventually, it's something I've learned to live with and I'm quite good at coping now, thanks for the concern regardless.

I've also sold pretty much everything I had or owned, partially to make a bit of money and partially because I wanted the house clear so I wasn't leaving a load of junk for my landlord to have to move.

Thanks for the reply. There's the ongoing debate about the canal deaths and wether or not a "pusher" is responsible, its been discussed at length on this sub, but a few of the hotspots are Durham and Manchester.

A lot of people attribute it to drunkenness, but the rate does admittedly seem suspiciously high, and there's some really strange cases, like a guy missing for 3 weeks, then being found about 40 metres from where he disappeared and was seen on CCTV. Souvik Pal was his name.Wew, you okay buddy? What a great, content enriching thread u have created.The Pianis.

Sorry ill see myself out. I can't believe you're arguing that there is a gap there, like, I want to believe you're just trolling but you seriously seem to believe there is a gap there. The "shadow" that you're pointing out is present all over both letters, in both sides of the V, on the W in multiple places,..

There's nothing wrong with the resolution, it's clearly from a HDTV but there's done quality loss because of how zoomed in the image needs to be to highlight a car logo, you do know how small these things are right?

Ive honestly never used the word shill, or been interested in calling people out for it, but if you aren't trolling the guy, then my only other assumption is that there's some alternative agenda here for you, it's as clear as day that there isn't a gap, I'm not really interested in arguing what my eyes see vs yours because we both know  theres no winner there, but claiming there's a gap in this logo is like claiming the sky is green to me.

Edit: https://imgur.com/a/va3ZShC

??? Martyrs, I've said near enough the same thing before but the horror comes from the hopeless of the situation the people are in and the fact that there's never really any hope for them.

That and the truly horrific things that happens in the film.

At the end of the day, ghost and zombies and critters aside, a lot, if not nearly all of the most horrifying and degraded things that happen in this world are things that are done by people to people.

Edit: a comma Fleshgaits were invented on 4chan, as per gostmen, I'm assuming skinwalkers, who actually are/previously were humans who basically went down a nasty path. Skinwalkers are most certainly malicious and its through their own choosing, try either the r/skinwalkers sub and read up on some of the higher rated posts by people of Navajo background, they can and have done a 10x better job explaining them than I could hope to. I don't want to sound like a stiff or like I have a hard on for rules but your last post was about how this board is too confining and how you feel you can't discuss the case or your ideas openly and your very next post is a thinly veiled way of saying "if the police told us who BG is we could take justice into our own hands", and let's face it, that's all this is, because I highly doubt the implication is "if I knew who BG was boy o boy would I steer clear of that rascal"

This is the exact reason LE will never come out and say "oh we think it's person X but we aren't THAT sure" or "guys it IS person X watch out" because of this idea of mob justice that 9 times out of 10 ends up with some poor guy who doesn't even know anything about what he's being accused of, getting the shit kicked out of him. 

Look at the dog and the trousers to get some perspective/see how warped this image is, the trousers lok further away, but are about 1 and a 1/2 the size of the dog. Just image angles. It shouldn't even need to be amsaid but veterans should 100% get priority and combat vets should be at the very top of that list. It's one thing to serve and do your time, but to literally risk your life for your country, the very least the government should do is make sure these people don't end up on the street. They do say the oldies are the goldies. I'd go the American horror story route of wiping 2 witches minds and allowing the world to end, whilst burying myself along with the other remaining survivors of my coven, then emerging from the ground and finding these two witches, reviving them, and then allow all but one to die, whereupon I would commit suicide and allow myself to pass my power on to the other witch, who could then travel back in time to put a stop to whatever wrong was about to cause the world to end.

Pretty simple stuff really.

Failing that id have myself frozen and unfrozen 100 years from now for some whacky wasteland adventures. Your mom.





Sorry I couldn't help myself. ApocalypseNo pets.Just signup with a made up name....? As others have stated there's no solid proof the medan ever sailed, let alone that it was a real ship, I looked into it myself a while ago and recall that there was no shipping records, maybe one that was somewhat similar, and that the only real source originally was a newspaper article around the time it was rumoured to have taken place. There's a lot about the story itself that doesn't add up, who tried to tow it, why isn't it logged anywhere, why aren't it's last coordinates recorded for investigative purposes etc. Good lick though, as sceptical as I sound I still love a mystery and would like to believe, doo doo doooooo

Edit: my bad, you covered all of what I said and it's an excellent write up, surprisingly well researched too, good job buddyI'm actually seriously quite excited to hear what he saw inside the laboratory, unfortunately his phone has been confiscated while he was waiting in line for the tour, (they must run a ticket booth at the front of the laboratory for tour tickets) so we're just going to have to take his word for it, or hopefully we will get to read the secret document. I wouldn't mind but this is the third thread today and op is just using the sub as his dear diary for some made up fantasy, which might even be okay if it was believable but every post so far has been terribly written and crazily unbelievable, from a vague description of his town "to the west is a snow mountain" to the fact that he has secret documents but instead of sharing them he's going to go back to the HQ of the people who have him under surveillance, yet its US who he can't trust?

The entire thing seems like something my 5 year old nephew would make up and at the risk of sounding bitter, its making this sub look like the gathering ground for a bunch of morons. u/Project-Tempus

This is OPs alt of anyone is interested, it's getting beyond boring now seeing these constant threads. Although the posts on ARG about voice logs are legit hilarious.

An extract 

'Russell in bush' 
Whats was that? 
'More russelling in bush'
Oh its just a rabbit. 


An absolute stalwart of literature, I still wonder what Russel was up to in that bush though. 

Sorry but this is just ridiculous, please stop shitting up the sub with made up stories about farmers and laboratories And any reason you posted that this was an ARG 17 hours ago and that you had made everything up? No offence but it seems like you're looking a bit too much into this, if they were doing anything 'sinister' they wouldn't open their doors to the public for starters, and before anyone gives it the old 'well it's a perfect cover /front' no, it really isn't, they just wouldn't let people in and claim it was for industry based confidentiality.

I'm not trying to be a dick but all the people just wishing him luck and the likes are encouraging the guy to end up getting arrested for trespassing.

If they really any 'up to something' do you honestly expect not to get caught sneaking into an off the record research laboratory front? And what if they really are involved in something sinister and you do get caught? They aren't going to let you walk our the front door with a gift bag.

I think you need to either reel in your imagination or take a good look at what you're planning to do, because at BEST it's going to end with you having a criminal record and looking like some sort of kook. Just my 2c anyway. *slaps anaconda* you can fit so many small children inside of this bad boy I scrolled past and thought the title said 'my cats anus is huge' and thought hang on that can't be right, scrolled back up, read the title again, looked at the cat and thought well I was wrong, but I wasn't technically wrong. I love these type of posts because the more and more badass they try to sound the more and more they sound like an absolute retard, it's like watching a guy knock a vase over and just chip it, then he tries to fix it and ends up breaking it completely, so he grabs some superglue he's got in his pocket, but the lid has worked its way off, he's got glue on his fingers, he hasn't realised yet, he grabs bits of vase, the vase is now stuck to him, he tries to remove it with his glue-virgin territory hand, now his hands are stuck together, finally the debacle ends with him telling you if you ever tell anyone what has occurred, there will be a repeat of the same terrible fate that befell an ignorant and ill informed drill sargaent in the tequila and head injury riddled summer of 2017.It was always maoam, the advert used to sign out M A O A M - maoam, it being a palindrome is what made the advert catchy...*front wheel slips off rail towards water*
hello dedI don't think mint is able to smell, it doesn't have a nose.Also don't forget to brush your tongue, again, focusing on the back of it. Lots of people neglect brushing their tongue and it actually contributes a hell of a lot to your oral hygiene.Maybe they've just altered or changed the menu over the years but left the #s as they originally were, if they changed them and someone ordered a #7, not knowing the menu had been changed, they would end up getting the wrong order. I don't know but it's just a thought.Nor I but I like seeing threads like this on this sub, all too often it seems like people don't really see the purpose here and 90% of the threads are a variation of "is this an ME" while there's very little discussion on the whys/hows. 

Assuming for a minute it was confirmed and the ME becomes less of an effect and more of a solid fact, it begs the question why is it happening and also how is it happening, what/who is changing things and WHY are they doing it. If it's a person or group of people then there must be a reason, if it's something more 'natural' then proving it happens alone will change our perception of everything in the world and challenge pretty much every concept theory and fact we have today about physics, the universe and what we know as being 'real'.

At the end of the day I know as is Mandela effect believers are basically equatable to tinfoil hat wearers, but I feel a lot of people fail to realise or don't really acknowledge as much as they should just how much of a game changer it would be if this was proven to be real.

Anyway blathering over.Just to play devil's advocate maybe there isn't any method of direct communication available to whoever is making the changes, maybe they can't make drastic changes like swapping Amazon's name from Amazon to "North Korea r gunna nuke the world in 2025" or maybe it's literally the only method available to them for whatever reason, (only small alterations can be made) etcJust make a list of all the ones we haven't discovered yetI guess i kinda agree, as i said ive had dreams before about him but hes been gone like 7 years now so it seems kinda odd. Some real r/kenM material here too. "We only know 3% about". How does he know we only know 3% about the cosmos? Does he have a list of everything about the cosmos but only 3% of it is ticked off?

And 3% about EVERYTHING? Really? Were doing much better as a species than i thoughtU commited the crime buddyr/murderedbywordsI remember this one, where the guys wife isn't letting on but she knows a lot more about what happened than the husband, being from Russia herself. It was a really good read and i was upset there was no follow up : (I think about this often too, if i happened to die i don't think anyone would discover my body, so yeah i can totally see where OP is coming from, it's a really depressing thought and i think for those in that type of situation things can easily snowball to the point where they decide to go "missing" Im sat here thinking yeah right this is all camera angle and thenThank you, great eye!I think this is just people looking into things too much, the statement had to use a word, that word happened to be people, if they had said someone instead if people would we then take that as concrete evidence that only one person was involved? They literally had to use a word and that word just happened to be people.

I understand LE have kept their cards close to their heart in this particular case but at the same time i strongly doubt that if LE wanted to release additional information to the public they would do it in a cryptic way or a way that could only be discerned by reading inbetween the lines.

Just as a personal opinion/side note i think the way the information in this case has been treat/released has done so much harm its getting beyond ridiculous, if people had spent the time that has been spent speculating on insignificant details (how the girls died, how they were found, is the murder on the tape/audio) on actually trying to solve the case and on meaningful points of interest we might be a bit further along.
Funnily enough wars tend to be a major influence on beards being in fashion, a few examples are the end of the Crimean war, soldiers were returning home with beards making them the sign of a "hero" if you will, which helped being them into fashion, along with the scarcity of soap at the time, the same happened with Vietnam and beards in america. 

On the contrary when soldiers were required to be clean shaven for the fitting of gas masks, beards went out of fashion.

Additionally with the launch of gillete and the dawn of targetted and large scale marketing, clean shaving became a big thing.

Obviously there are other factors affecting their popularity but this should be a nice starting point for you to look in to.

Personally i don't give a shit about wars regarding my beard and thusly havent shaven for over a year.

They've tweeted and said it was an error/mistake and they didn't even realise the tweet had been sent, sorry to be the bearer of bad news.Ill give you the benefit of doubt that you aren't a troll but dudes well in shape, well defined V shape from his lats, traps and upper back are well built, he doesnt look like an underwear model, granted and maybe he doesnt look like he lifts in clothes to most people but that dude is stacked and strong.Kinda like mass hysteria innitKinda like mass hysteria innitI'd like a pm too pleaseWhat about "weird"Whilst not exactly a seemingly happy setting, spec ops; the line, played out like a standard army/war shootemup to begin with, then things started getting a bit awry as you played through and things just ramped up to 100mp/h by the mid-end to end game culminating in a review of what you have done over the course of the game and you just think "wow i fucked up" 

Its well planned though because you're making the decisons you "have" to and it serves as a great reminder that the path to hell can be paved with good intentions.

Really underrated gem of a game. Maybe not underrated, but i don't see it recommended too often.Fingers crossed.I think after anna was raped and murdered Jessica decided to seduce him in order to get close enough to be able to plot his demise.10,000,000I lived in a town called billingham for most of my life, a guy called Billy Dunlop murdered a girl called Julie Hogg back in the 80s and was tried for her murder twice and acquitted both times and under the double jeopardy law at the time that meant he couldnt be retried for the same crime, after this all happened he ended up confessing to the crime thinking he was "untouchable", his mother basically started campaigning to have the law changed so he could be retried, and eventually succeeded and he was retried in the end and ended up getting a life sentence/minimum of 17 years.Yah this guy is pretty much spot on, YMMV but ive both been over and seen plenty of people go over in my time, one time i was actually speaking to a guy i had seen OD a few times and i knew the telltale signs, i told the guy next to me to get ready to call and ambulance and for the sht to hit the fan because i knew he was going over, not a nice thing to witness tbh, even less so when you actually know its about to happen before it does, it was like watching a train wreck about to happen and if you arent in possesion narcan yourself then there is literally nothing you can do other than wait for the person to pass out, then phone 999/get ready to start performing CPR.SPOILERS

Its a movie about torture basically, theres a group of people who think pushing someone to the brink of death/suffering allows them to see into the afterlife, so they torture people, badly. Towards the end a woman is basically skinned alive to nearly the bone, tied up by the wrists so she is held up and has huge lights/sunbed style lamps aimed at her.

Aside from the torture etc i think the reason its so scary/disturbing is the fact that at no point during the movie is the illusion given that the people who have been captured will have ANY chance of escaping at all, like its never hinted at, there's no woman saving a piece of plastic from her dinner plate and freeing herself or the likes, she gets locked in a room and you KNOW she's going to be tortured and i think that makes it very real, its. a situation that is very imagineable and makes you think about it in real life, people behave exactly how someone who is kidnapping and torturing people behave, doors are locked, there's lots of locked doors between people and freedom, guard are alert and not metal gear solid/movies guard clichs walking around with a big question mark above their heads.Indeed do I.Anything you wanna talk about buddy?Calm down Jango, there's just been an accident, a terrible accident, but an accident nonetheless.FBIThis is clearly a joke, i seriously hope no one believes the guy or gal wrote this as a true story"Should we address the fact that the eighth graders are now carrying knives?"

"Probably, but only after we tackle the problem of people using memes at school, this is the real problem"Okay i apologize for labeling aliens as being paranormal, i don't really want to get too sidetracked with this though, so yeah 'the paranormal (psychics/ghosts) OR other strange things like aliens.Well semantics with the aliens thing,..regardless, a being or object from another planet or whatever would be alien to us, still I'm not entirely sure where you're going with this.

Also your point about psychics assumes that being psychic means you can predict the future and that alone, maybe psychics are able to read minds or see other locations remotely? 

I guess seeing as how you are the skeptic mentioned in my post, what would it take to convince YOU personally otherwise? What event or experience would it take?Why not? Sure it'll start off grim, a death toll of millions, unspeakable atrocities, etc, but you will see hitler rise from the dead, the allies will have a change of heart and retreat across germany, repairing untold amounts of damage and removing bullets and knife wounds from countless german soldiers, over the course of the next few years an enormous rejuvenation program will be enacted, millions will rise from the dead, millions of jews will hop onto trains out of death camps and be led back to their homes where their doors will be refitted to their hinges, by german soldiers who will go about righting wrongs of the future past! Life in reverse woulld be great! Especially WW2.As posted in a link above entering 017901709170197010791071907109710 would cover every possible combination, now given the fact that there isnt a cancel button and neither the asterix or hash key have any wear, its safe to assume you need to enter neither at the end of the code and the keypad will accept any input as long as it contains the correct sequence, so let's say the code is 1970, the keypad would probably accept 891970 as the correct code.

Some assumptions and mathematics.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_sequenceOkay, thanks for the reply btw! Its nice to see devs in the community, ill be coming back to this game as soon as its finished : )Watch out boys we got a r/madlads on the looseI installed it looks like story mode isn't available yet, has snyone been far into arcade mode yet? Is it basically different arcade type levels i.e no sort of quests/exploring etc? It looks really good but i think ill hold off until its fully releasedThe numbered ones look like HTML color codes, as for all the 0's, no idea, 000000 (6 0's) is just black, ill have a count of the zeros, it could just be the colour layout of something though im afraid, very anticlimactic but yeah.Farscapehttps://www.google.co.uk/amp/alonesomes.tumblr.com/post/44152939484/do-not-fall-in-love-with-people-like-me-people/amp

This is the original, its been butchered for some reason.I wonder what finally made them realize they were better off just leaving it out after a COUPLE OF YEARS of being beaten up Half of it is from a short poem written by Caitlyn Siehl and the storms part is tagged on the end and not from the original, it sounds familiar and it also sounds like something John Greene might write but im probsbly wrong, regardless, my point is that it is satireMisery. Both film and book, its not backwoods entirely but its definetly in that genre/has a feeling for it.Why is this guy getting downvoted for trying to help :( if you think he's wrong then reply and say so, downvoting soneone in a matter like this might put people off or disuade them from posting at all, u guys can be real mean sometimesThe best that comes to mind are r/paranormal and at a big stretch, r/Cryptozoology not exactly matches but pretty close.

Edited because it took 4 attempts to link crypto properly, (its 4am.)We hired a few new guys at work maybe 4 or 5 years ago and one of them was this 6"5 really blokes bloke, always full of jokes, quick witted ex pipe fitter. He got along with people really well but over time i learned he really liked a drink, a bit too much.

Anyway over the yesrs on one or two occasions he kind of let slip that he had a bit of a chequered past, im the kind of guy who prefers to listen to people and piece together what i can, over time he slowly moved up to supervision and ended up in charge of me, but there was always a feeling about him i couldnt shake.

Between his drinking and my "observations" i figured he had maybe been in trouble for domestic abuse maybe, hitting his wife or even his mother? Anyway fast forward a few more years and i come into work one morning as usual and news has broke, someone has recognised him, as he always had lived in the area, and let us know he was a convicted pedophile.

In hindsight a LOT of the flags were there, he was too handy with technology for a man of his age and he had become really friendly with one of the girls on site who just so happened to look a lot younger than she actually was.

I always had a bit of an off feeling about him but generally unless you have concrete evidence you never mention someone's name and paedophilia in the same breath. Really harrowing though, especially thinking back about certain things that had happened and such. Good riddance anyway.I feel like im being trolled.A genius who doesnt have a decent vocabulary because he missed out on 8th grade vocabulary stuff. The very font of vocabulary stuff, the absolute FOUNTAIN of expanding ones vocabulary stuff, THE EIGHTH GRADE.I dont really see why this is a problem tbh, this is probabky going to be an j popular opinion but whatever, if youre being advertised to not knowing, or just knowing the basics, of what idle heroes is, i strongly doubt youre going to know enough about the game to know either who sigmund is or the stength he has in the game, if this was an advert actually selling something for say monetary gain then yeah by all means, I'd be well against it myself, but this just seems like much ado over nothing.

Its not correct, true, but it sort of gives you the gist of what the game is, i wouldn't be surprised if this was made by someone in marketing who doesnt even play the game and got a vague job briefing.

Theres plenty in this game to be narked about as is, i don't see the point in finding insult where there isn't really any.

Sorry if this has turned into what sounds like a rant but i see the same sort of behaviour in a lot of other games i play, particularly gacha, and it really irks me because i think its kinda toxic for the community. It sounds like, as in many cases, this song was recorded specifically for the shamless episode and as such there wont be a release of it and very possibly, there wont even be a full length version of it, sorry!Coca cola 61 variations of ahh [h* x] as part of an advertising campaign.Can we see them? It'd really help tbh especially if they arent scars, someone would possibly be able to tell you what they are, either way it doesnt exactly sound naturalUrban legend or rumour if it can be called that? says its a sign that theres a drug dealer in that street, it wouldn't suprise me if it was true though, i know in my area a lot of heroin dealers hang the exact same ornament in their front window, its pretty handy. Coyotes seeing reintroduced wolves for the last timeSort of related, give "you cant be neutral on a moving train" a listen, it mentions this ane many other similar instances, the song itself will prompt you to do a lot of googling, bonus points too because its actually a good song.

Honestly very impressive.Just reading this thread, u have serious mental issues my friendIt's a bucket full of firestartersSo would you expect say a wolf in the wild to suffer from a range of dental problems like decay, 'needing fillings' and rotten teeth then? 

Id imagine it could be an almost death penalty for an animal that relies on being able to chew through some pretty rough food constantly, like i class myself as having a pretty good pain tolerance but i had a broken tooth once and it was game over, no sleep, no food etc

Also ty for the insight so far, you all raise good points.Came here to s... Nah just kidding, more specifically though Ubik is close to what you're looking for OP, as is The three stigmata of palmer eldritch, yup, both by, you guessed it, Phillip k dick.I just started this last night too, i don't come here often any more but im sure i saw it recommended on reddit, is it big here? I actually came to find similar books as it has really brought some spark back into my love of books.Just be patient, the idea of the game is that when you can't progress, you just wait it out, that being said, idle on a campaign level that drops equipment of all types for loot so you can forge better gear, gear REALLY helps, upgrade some artifacts, wait on prophet orbs, don't forget the super casino,.. 

Also whilst guild coins are best spent on tech, considering how new you are and are lacking a full team of 5* you should buy the 10 5* shards from the guild shop and the brave trial shop so you can get an easy 5*, also don't neglect monsters, a few levels put into monsters for HP/ATK can make a huge difference.

Most importantly though, do some idling. This isn't a personal attack or anything but i mean even if you get past this wall, you're going to hit another one in like 10 campaign levels or so, then will you be back posting here again? Its just the way the game and basically every other game that isn't skill based is, just some food for thought. You see him a few times, guy with the white bands on his arms actually punches him at.mid point and you see his arm.come up past the bar once or twice, but yes hes on the floor before it beginsTy so much <3Get in touch with James Randi and claim that i can teleport my 100 dollar bill out of his pocket when he leaves the room and claim my 1 million dollar prize from him for proving something paranormal.Battlestar Galactica where adama jumps his battlestar into new earth's atmosphere so his vipers can launch while the battlestar freefalls, then jumps back out before it hits the ground.

https://youtu.be/3AjXgY35iZgCant claim my 10+1 ticket :(Luneth, i got dark veritas confused with flame, my bad, also as for tms i haven't farmed a single one since dual wiekd and excluding event tm's I've managed to get roughly 12, the moogles you get really add up, there's a 10% from the arena every month if you do "mediocre" really easy to get, 2% a week from weekend dailies, this months daily login gives like 20%, mog king gives 15%... really you'll have a few in no time at all.

I wouldn't worry about summons too much either youre basically sorted for tank/healer/mage/chain caps. You could do with a unit like onion knight or tidus even but this is really just perfect world scenario, with the team you can put together you'll be able to clear a lot of the vortex trials i think, there's some nice gear to be gotten there alone, and before you start the story read up on the "vault keys quest" on the wiki, you can get some realllyy nice gear (germinas boots, apocalypse, amongst many others) by doing really easy turn in quests. Never really on pulling a good character, bring up who you have now and if you happen to pull a better replacement then switch them, but RNG is RNG, ive played for over a year and pulled 5 5* bases, so yeah.Wol is top tier breaker and tank so bring him up definetly, earth veritas is a good situational tank but WOL is bread and butter. Noctis is still a very good and viable all rounder, id bring rem up as a situational healer and read up on chaining, dark veritas and luneth are good finishers but you're lacking a meta chain creator, Ashe will do for the time being though, barbariccia is also 2nd best mafe iirc atm, i have a T. Terra and i still find good use for mages. 

TM wise, dual wield is nice to have but a lot of the better DPS have it innate now, definetly finish it though, definelty look at, katana mastery, large sword mastery (trial reward), get a good large sword, Excalibur is an easy one to grab due to how common Cecil is, i go more for sustain tms in general now because the game is kinda more about survival, with that in mind anything with auto refresh (emperors majesty is my favourite) and anything that gives 30% of a given stat,..(quick assault)..also dark knights soul, proud fencer, bracer, champions belt.

Honestly i could go on but you'll have to read some TM lists i just hope this is a nice outline for you.

As for growth egg ehhhhh, i find 99% of the time i level a unit its using cactuars which i keep a stash of at all times, (dunes is up ATM, fuse the big metals and save the kings). If its between the eggs and say a tech cryst then get the egg, but if its an egg vs a ticket get the ticket.

Edit: also noticed you have a mystea, bring her up as well, another top tier tank.r/2mad4madladsI think when the ghouls ask you if you reply nothing you get a lunch box, i said nothing to Santa earlier and ended up getting his outfit, but im not sure if that was the actual quest reward or if he actually gave me itI commented for a bookmark, so no, i hadn't, I have now though tyOh wow ive been waiting so long for an update from you OP, i thought maybe youd died or been murdered or just got sick of writing this out, im so glad you came backIt used to stop people stealing them back befofe literally everyone had a pair of headphones/ear phones because its an uncommon jack type, it cuts down on cost too, if you think of how many seats there are on a plane and X that by the price of the headset were talking a lot of money for HEADPHONES, so if one side of the audio went, which i find to be a pretty damn common problem, the headset still worked to a point.I like at the end of the video how the roomba is going back to its "base camp"? as if its all yup, did a good job there, back onto sentry duty.You definetly ahould. Seriously though, yes. Id even recommend playing xcom 1 first because 2 adds so much content that id personally find it very hard to play 1 after playing 2, but 1 in its own is an amazing game also.Strongly doubt its this...http://www.scaryforkids.com/kittens/

I just had a quick google and found it quite funny how this looks like the budget version of the story you described, the "the room" of horrorI came up against a team that I wiped turn 1 save for their noctis and lacking tbe magic damage to break his mechanical heart and damage warp i was stuck in a loop with this noctis whittling my hp away, eventually i tried summoning Odin and lo and behold, i figure most people who gear for evade neglect to gear for death be it oversight or lack of slots.

Tldr; zantetsuken an evade unit. Usually works.I actually read this on reddit a few days ago but i re watched the scene and its crazy, in the hateful eight when Kurt Russell smashes up the guitar, he's actually smashing up a super expensive genuine guitar from the martin museum, if you watch the scene JJ Leigh looks straight off set at whoever, director, prop guy... shouting WOAH WOAH and you can actually see the disbelief in her face. Its a shamelessly stolen/reposted fact but its amazing to watch so i thought id share it.Also i don't even feel the main issue is trolls or afk'ers its people who just don't know how to play, i honestly don't think you should need to tell someone to not focus a tank or to stop engaging every single time you are near the enemy because "its the point of the game", these people should be set back in rank for their own good so they actually start getting better, whatever though, rant over hahaI really do think the issue is the fact that you still gain rank even when you lose, like i still pick up 20 or so points and some of them are literally for not leaving the game, i think you should advance minimally if you lose, if maybe only pick up the points for a loss if you have a win rate over a certain %, it just means there's people plowing through the ranks purely for playing the game, it seems like a really poor system.Okay, ive been adding people here and there so i guess ill make more of an effort to make some buddies, again i know what i said comes across as kind of arrogant but i was just voicing some thoughts, thanks for the reply!Good point, a rreallly sharp knife? I cb i missed thatIn hindsight you're doing the best thing there i sort f worded that post badly/misconstrued what i meant i guess, you're right to be chaining for a strong friend unit i was just hyping up firion some, i guess what i meant was its worth saving up for firions enhancements and gearing him up as best as possible as your own chain capper until you pull someone better, i personally feel the game has a serious lack of variety for finishers hence my long use of firion, i even find more often than not the majority of my friends have a chainer up and i end up still using my own firion, just some food for thought anyway.I think you're underestimating firion a bit, even unenhanced hes still imo one of the best one but finishers, especially considering he comes at 3*, if i were you id look into replacing one of your units with him, possibly setzer, he's got 2 innate demon killers and plenty of atk+ passives, he can cap a chain off pretty nicely using the units you have. Worth some thought anyway, this is coming from a 1 + 1/2 year player who up until about 2 weeks ago was still using a stacked firion.

Also feel free to send me a friend request 106,607,384. Ill even put my firion up if you want hahaWhat made this worse for me personally was i thought the hood maker was outstanding TV, then forbidden planet fell so flat on its face and it hasnt picked up a lot since then IMO, forbidden planet felt so camp and anti climatic, the ending to a few of the episodes have been this huge build up and then im left thinking "hang on that can't be the end" and alas, it is.Nothing a sharp knife wouldn't solve. Source; work with lots of hosepipes.This probably always gsts brought up but just across from the mona lisa is "The wedding at cana", its a marvellous painting and some cheekily refer to it as the reason mona is smiling.

P.s sorry i don't know how to format links
It doesn't fit the poc/lgbt thing but the shadow over innsmouth by HP Lovecraft is one of the most atmospheric horrors I've ever read, i personally find a lot of Lovecraft's writing hit or miss but innsmouth was such a good small towny type horror that it sparked my interest in finding similar stories, i think it nailed how a story should be written in terms of both horror and mental imagery, when reading it i was picturing evey scene and the layout of the town itself in my head to the point where thinking back now, i could be forgiven for mistakenly thinking id watched a film instead of reading a book!Check the wiki, also try browsing YouTube for "lets play" type battles because they are really good guides by some people, also consider farming the gil snappers cave next time its up, i had the exact same problem with agrias and farmed enough to awaken every ability and still have 2million left over. Failing that use your friend points to summon level 1 shitters, max their level to 30, 5 units at a time using the exp vortex dungeon and a decent friend unit, then sell the units for i think 15,000 a go, easy 75k gil per 30 NRG.https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Best_places_to_farmSpecifically the mama? Not really, as said below or above gauntlets could be useful but equip L shield is obtainable from an aurora key as a materia and i personally think the equipment slot is more valuable if given the choice.Oh yeah forgot to mention, got the add though and my bahamut! Thanks, feel free to remove me, I have a few decent leads but its up to you buddy! <3Sent you an add, thanks in advance buddy!Sent you an invite also my manNo i finished it thank you! Feel free to remove me too IGN Zaitsev. Thanks for the add buddyDont quote me because I'm no expert by any means but I recall 2 good possible explanations, one being that there was possibly minks in the area and their scent was attracting dogs, and the second, which ties in with the first, is due to the construction of the bridge and a dogs perception in its vision looks to them like it either isn't a high drop, or that there is grass just on the other side of the walls, I think some.of the backing up evidence was all the jumpers were from the same side or area and that it was mostly dogs with longer snouts.The fact that we are waterproof or near enough waterproof amazes me, I'm not 100% sure if we are because science but yeah, I work in really wet environments where my work gear is usually soaking wet and it always dawns on me that my skin is this amazing waterproof layer, especially when I wear a full body "wet suit" and even they don't manage to keep me dry, but something as simple as skin is impervious.

I doubted he was fearless at first but jeezOh wow he's from my home town, weird seeing it here on redditCan u imagine the madness. Guys lets put pots and pans on our heads and get a photo, MENTALI'm no chopsticks expert but if thats the business end of the chopsticks then there's no jello on themTbh this is pretty mad because even small amounts of soy sauce can kill you due to its salt content, a truly mad lad.It was also good use of a phrase adama used liberally, "get your fat lazy arse out of my office", on par with classics such as "get your fat lazy arse out of that rack Roslin" and "chief, get your fat lazy arse up here"Spec ops: the line, first play through of that game is great and it does a magically job at storytelling, its one of the best story driven games ive played and considering it comes from a genre that produces more flops than most with story it really is a breath of fresh air, evem down to the soundtrack of the game, which personally I rarely notice unless its a real good soundtrack.Bag of cans with the lads <3I work food hygiene and you'd be surprised at the state of factory machine guards and fitting, rest assured though any bolts I personally removed sit in caustic soda for 10 hours to save me a long walk to the fitting shop and to make life easierIt kind of does yeah but at the end of the day i cant see a free bundle being anything that the hackers would even appreciate, if they manage to ban every bot account, its fine and if they don't manage to, then these people are still capable of giving themselves free items/lapis/refill orbs etc, so they arent actually gaining anything they werent already able to give themselves, i think regardless they owe to the people who have put both time and money into this, i hope they dontst the actions of a few take away from the honest work of the many.In fact 2 slots, demonstrating some great math skills there lolTy for that, id posed this question recently but its nice to know, im running dragon killer x4 for 200%, legend killer for 75% and 3x poach for 45% so it turns out im....wasting an equip slot. Cheers lad!105,607,384Keeping going personally, also got a dragon killer stacked firion, 9x dragon killer, if anyone wants to add me ive just expanded friend slots and id rather help /ffbe players firstFft-0 is actually a pretty enjoyable game, i understand to people who havent played it or don't know what it is how it could be seen as a bit disappointing, but at the end of the day the event is free materials, items and tickets (which there's no obligation to use) during an event that will give you a bit of a break from burnout/a chance to grind time/lapis/trials,.

The type-0 whining is getting pretty boring and it comes across as being pretty ungrateful tbh Doesn't matter how many times you fall off the wagon as long as you always get back onThe baby plane never flies far from its motherProbably this, its not uncommon to find expiry codes with a date on foodstuffs that don't really perish within the month stated, the date is just there to cover the conpanies backs. I'd eat a chocolate bar a year out of date, let alone a week.I just want my wol 6*, is that too much to ask gumiIm sorry about whats happened and i know it doesn't mean much, or isnt much consolation, but he must have already made the decision so there's not much for you to feel guilty about honestly.

From personal experience i know time is the best healer and although it doesn't seem like it now, at all, with time the burden with be lessened, theres not much point in lying to you, things like this do stay with you for life, you never really get over them, but you will learn to handle it better, we never really heal fully, we just become better at carrying these things.

Another thing worth noting is that anti depressants can cause/increase suicidal feelings/thoughts/impulses, (strange i know) but it really is worth mentioning to your therapist or doctor. 

Whatever you do, keep staying strong.It could be an association problem by now, in that the alcohol isn't really helping you but its all youve ever known TO help you, i myself had/have some dependency issues and it sounds like you're going down the road to addiction, rationalising things is usually a sign, as is merely feeling better after indulging.

If i were you id try to start cutting down by tapering, maybe instead of every 2 hours, have a drink every 3, keep that process up slowly, and after a week you'll be drinking overall maybe 1 less can/spirit etc.

Its entirely your call though, i could be 300% off the mark, whatdya think?Machine weights don't really work stabilising muscles so its an expectable wobbly transition haha, its easier to just think of it as muscles shortening and pulling parts of your body in, then its pretty obvious what to do to correct it, good luck though!Im sorry you feel that way and can empathise with your situation, you're still young and free though, there's nothing tying you down and i know it might not seem like it but life's just getting started for you, i wouldn't worry too much about the baby either, its only natural people will seem to be showing a new child more affection,

I know its hard to believe and easy to shoot down but sometimes the coldest seeming people are harbouring the best intentions for you.

Don't worry about your work mates either, they don't really sound like the nicest of people anyway so why bother with them, and if push comes to shove, you still got us lot to shove around!As you said yourself you've seen it get better before, you already know these are temporary feelings and thoughts buddy, you just gotta really see that. Like really.

You can have as many more chances as you like as long as you never stop trying.

It sounds like you've really got your head screwed on and know whats going on, is there something specific that set you on a bad course?

(edited because i sounded a bit condescending)Be forewarned i have no medical experience;

I myself had (what looked and seemed) like a case of ATP and the best thing i did for it was to lift and stretch/yoga, lower body wise you want to look into some hip flexor stretches mainly, but don't overlook abdominal exercises because one of the reasons for ATP is over taxed back muscles. 

Upstairs, simple shoulder stretches and if you do feel like lifting, shoulder exercises will help pull you shoulders back into posture.

Honestly though the main thing to do is to naturally correct your own posture through force of habit, go stand against a wall and flatten your back and the base of your neck against the wall, pull your shoulders back so you are stood just how you would imagine a soldier to stand, head tall arms by the side, now remember to keep your posture like this, all day. Bad posture is most often a bad habit that can be fixed with a little dedication.Agreed, i feel often the scariest stories don't involve the paranormal or things outside our normal world, but instead the cruelty and harm that human beings are capable of inflicting upon one anotherIf you mean economizer it was just a joke, its an item drop in FF6I have a ling I have equipped for the event, her dance of death paralyzes/blinds 90% of the time and she has an AOE esuna, good dodge fire resist etc. 105,607,384.
